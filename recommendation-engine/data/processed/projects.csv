It was created by an anonymous individual/group under the name, Satoshi Nakamoto. The source code is available publicly as an open source project, anybody can look at it and be part of the developmental process.

Bitcoin is changing the way we see money as we speak. The idea was to produce a means of exchange, independent of any central authority, that could be transferred electronically in a secure, verifiable and immutable way. It is a decentralized peer-to-peer internet currency making mobile payment easy, very low transaction fees, protects your identity, and it works anywhere all the time with no central authority and banks.

Bitcoin is designed to have only 21 million BTC ever created, thus making it a deflationary currency. Bitcoin uses the SHA-256 hashing algorithm with an average transaction confirmation time of 10 minutes. Miners today are mining Bitcoin using ASIC chip dedicated to only mining Bitcoin, and the hash rate has shot up to peta hashes.

Being the first successful online cryptography currency, Bitcoin has inspired other alternative currencies such as Litecoin, Peercoin, Primecoin, and so on.

The cryptocurrency then took off with the innovation of the turing-complete smart contract by Ethereum which led to the development of other amazing projects such as EOS, Tron, and even crypto-collectibles such as CryptoKitties.","2009-01-03","87.5","smart contract platform","unknown","71.05","50.513569722309526","99.94646892790627","16.900000000000002","1557","6019","64.3391641247672","0"

Examples of decentralized apps (dapps) that are built on Ethereum includes tokens, non-fungible tokens, decentralized finance apps, lending protocol, decentralized exchanges, and much more.

On Ethereum, all transactions and smart contract executions require a small fee to be paid. This fee is called Gas. In technical terms, Gas refers to the unit of measure on the amount of computational effort required to execute an operation or a smart contract. The more complex the execution operation is, the more gas is required to fulfill that operation. Gas fees are paid entirely in Ether (ETH), which is the native coin of the blockchain. The price of gas can fluctuate from time to time depending on the network demand.","2015-07-30","80.67","smart contract platform","unknown","71.05","47.107506583337035","99.91710984000967","16.900000000000002","1085","3620","64.07871344400338","0"

The idea was to create a stable cryptocurrency that can be used like digital dollars. Coins that serve this purpose of being a stable dollar substitute are called “stable coins.” Tether is the most popular stable coin and even acts as a dollar replacement on many popular exchanges! According to their site, Tether converts cash into digital currency, to anchor or “tether” the value of the coin to the price of national currencies like the US dollar, the Euro, and the Yen. Like other cryptos it uses blockchain. Unlike other cryptos, it is [according to the official Tether site] “100% backed by USD” (USD is held in reserve). The primary use of Tether is that it offers some stability to the otherwise volatile crypto space and offers liquidity to exchanges who can’t deal in dollars and with banks (for example to the sometimes controversial but leading exchange Bitfinex).

The digital coins are issued by a company called Tether Limited that is governed by the laws of the British Virgin Islands, according to the legal part of its website. It is incorporated in Hong Kong. It has emerged that Jan Ludovicus van der Velde is the CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, which has been accused of being involved in the price manipulation of bitcoin, as well as tether. Many people trading on exchanges, including Bitfinex, will use tether to buy other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Tether Limited argues that using this method to buy virtual currencies allows users to move fiat in and out of an exchange more quickly and cheaply. Also, exchanges typically have rocky relationships with banks, and using Tether is a way to circumvent that.

USDT is fairly simple to use. Once on exchanges like Poloniex or Bittrex, it can be used to purchase Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. It can be easily transferred from an exchange to any Omni Layer enabled wallet. Tether has no transaction fees, although external wallets and exchanges may charge one. In order to convert USDT to USD and vise versa through the Tether.to Platform, users must pay a small fee. Buying and selling Tether for Bitcoin can be done through a variety of exchanges like the ones mentioned previously or through the Tether.to platform, which also allows the conversion between USD to and from your bank account.

Like other cryptocurrencies, Ripple is built atop the idea of a distributed ledger network which requires various parties to participate in validating transactions, rather than any singular centralized authority. That facilitates transactions all over the world, and transfer fees are far cheaper than the likes of bitcoin. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, XRP transfers are effectively immediate, requiring no typical confirmation time.

Ripple was originally founded by a single company, Ripple Labs, and continues to be backed by it, rather than the larger network of developers that continue bitcoin’s development. It also doesn’t have a fluctuating amount of its currency in existence. Where bitcoin has a continually growing pool with an eventual maximum, and Ethereum theoretically has no limit, Ripple was created with all of its 100 billion XRP tokens right out of the gate. That number is maintained with no mining and most of the tokens are owned and held by Ripple Labs itself — around 60 billion at the latest count.

Even at the recently reduced value of around half a dollar per XRP, that means Ripple Labs is currently sitting on around $20 billion worth of the cryptocurrency (note: Ripple’s price crashed hard recently, and may be worth far less than $60 billion by time you read this). It holds 55 billion XRP in an escrow account, which allows it to sell up to a billion per month if it so chooses in order to fund new projects and acquisitions. Selling such an amount would likely have a drastic effect on the cryptocurrency’s value, and isn’t something Ripple Labs plans to do anytime soon.

In actuality, Ripple Labs is looking to leverage the technology behind XRP to allow for faster banking transactions around the world. While Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are built on the idea of separating financial transactions from the financial organizations of traditional currencies, Ripple is almost the opposite in every sense.

XRP by Ripple price can be found on this page alongside the market capitalization and additional stats.

It is a trading platform exclusively for cryptocurrencies. The name ""Binance"" is a combination of binary and finance.

Thus, the startup name shows that only cryptocurrencies can be traded against each other. It is not possible to trade crypto currencies against Fiat. The platform achieved an enormous success within a very short time and is focused on worldwide market with Malta headquarters. The cryptocurrency currently has a daily trading volume of 1.5 billion - 2 billion US dollars and is still increasing.

In total, there will only be 200 million BNBs. Binance uses the ERC20 token standard from Ethereum and has distributed it as follow: 50% sold on ICO, 40% to the team and 10% to Angel investors. The coin can be used to pay fees on Binance. These include trading fees, transaction fees, listing fees and others. Binance gives you a huge discount when fees are paid in BNB. 

The schedule of BNB fees discount is as follow: In the first year, 50% discount on all fees, second year 25% discount, third year 12.5% discount, fourth year 6.75 % discount, and from the fifth year onwards there is no discount. This structure is used to incentivize users to buy BNB and do trades within Binance.

Binance announced in a buyback plan that it would buy back up to 100 million BNB in Q1 2018. The coins are then burned. This means that they are devaluated to increase the value of the remaining coins. This benefits investors. In the future, the cryptocurrency will remain an asset on the trading platform and will be used as gas.

Other tokens that are issued by exchanges include Bibox Token, OKB, Huobi Token, and more.","2017-07-08","56.25","smart contract platform","ethereum","70.5","49.19152512021662","99.54156732250632","16.900000000000002","1696","2911","63.4493985628772","0"

Tron's mission is to build a truly decentralized internet and aims to be the largest blockchain-based operating system in the world, known as the TRON protocol. The TRON protocol will offer high scalability, high availability, and high throughput computing to serve decentralized applications via smart contracts. Ethereum EVM-based smart contracts will be compatible and deployable on the TRON network as such Solidity developers do not have to rewrite their applications.

Why Tron?
Since TRON protocol does not rely on proof of work or mining, instead governed by nodes located around the world, it is decentralized while providing high throughput for transactions on the blockchain. This is suitable for dapps that require high speed transactions especially games. There are a number of tokens already issued on the TRON network and the decentralized exchanges TRX.market has launched.

On July 24th 2018, TRON acquired BitTorrent, one of the largest P2P file sharing protocol. As a result of the acquisition, BitTorrent Token (BTT) was launched as the cryptocurrency to power the economics on the BitTorrent network. The Token will be used to inceltivize file sharing and storage within the network.

Dogecoin is a Litecoin fork. Introduced as a ""joke currency"" on 6 December 2013, Dogecoin quickly developed its own online community and reached a capitalization of US$60 million in January 2014. Compared with other cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin had a fast initial coin production schedule: 100 billion coins were in circulation by mid-2015, with an additional 5.256 billion coins every year thereafter. As of 30 June 2015, the 100 billionth Dogecoin had been mined. 

Dogecoin was created by Billy Markus from Portland, Oregon and  Jackson Palmer from Sydney, Australia. Both wanted to create a fun cryptocurrency that will appeal beyond the core Bitcoin audience. Dogecoin is primarily used as a tipping system on Reddit and Twitter where users tip each other for creating or sharing good content. The community is very active in organising fundraising activities for deserving causes.

The developers of Dogecoin haven’t made any major changes to the coin since 2015. This means that Dogecoin could get left behind and is why Shibas are leaving Dogecoin to join more advanced platforms like Ethereum. One of Dogecoin strengths is its relaxed and fun-loving community. However, this is also a weakness because other currencies are way more professional.

To purchase Dogecoin, it involves downloading a crypto wallet, setting up a crypto exchange account and then trading away for your desired crypto currency. Once we have set up an account with a DOGE currency exchange and deposited some funds, you are ready to start trading.

Bitcoin Cash intends to be a Bitcoin without Segregated Witness (SegWit) as soft fork, where upgrades of the protocol are done mainly through hard forks and without changing the original economic rules of the Bitcoin.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is released on 1st August 2017 as an upgraded version of the original Bitcoin Core software. The main upgrade is the increase in the block size limit from 1MB to 8MB. This effectively allows miners on the BCH chain to process up to 8 times more payments per second in comparison to Bitcoin. This makes for faster, cheaper transactions and a much smoother user experience.

Why was Bitcoin Cash Created?

The main objective of Bitcoin Cash is to to bring back the essential qualities of money inherent in the original Bitcoin software. Over the years, these qualities were filtered out of Bitcoin Core and progress was stifled by various people, organizations, and companies involved in Bitcoin protocol development. The result is that Bitcoin Core is currently unusable as money due to increasingly high fees per transactions and transfer times taking hours to complete. This is all because of the 1MB limitation of Bitcoin Core’s block size, causing it unable to accommodate to large number of transactions.

Essentially Bitcoin Cash is a community-activated upgrade (otherwise known as a hard fork) of Bitcoin that increased the block size to 8MB, solving the scaling issues that plague Bitcoin Core today.

Stellar aims to help facilitate cross-asset transfer of value at a fraction of a penny while aiming to be an open financial system that gives people of all income levels access to low-cost financial services. Stellar can handle exchanges between fiat-based currencies and between cryptocurrencies. Stellar.org, the organization that supports Stellar, is centralized like XRP and meant to handle cross platform transactions and micro transactions like XRP. However, unlike Ripple, Stellar.org is non-profit and their platform itself is open source and decentralized. 

Stellar was founded by Jed McCaleb in 2014. Jed McCaleb is also the founder of Mt. Gox and co-founder of Ripple, launched the network system Stellar with former lawyer Joyce Kim. Stellar is also a payment technology that aims to connect financial institutions and drastically reduce the cost and time required for cross-border transfers. In fact, both payment networks used the same protocol initially.

Distributed Exchange
Through the use of its intermediary currency Lumens (XLM), a user can send any currency that they own to anyone else in a different currency.

For instance, if Joe wanted to send USD to Mary using her EUR, an offer is submitted to the distributed exchange selling USD for EUR. This submitted offer forms is known as an order book. The network will use the order book to find the best exchange rate for the transaction in-order to minimize the fee paid by a user.

This multi-currency transaction is possible because of ""Anchors"". Anchors are trusted entities that hold people’s deposits and can issue credit. In essence, Anchors serves as the bridge between different currencies and the Stellar network.

Lumens (XLM)
Lumens are the native asset (digital currency) that exist on the Stellar network that helps to facilitate multi-currency transactions and prevent spams. For multi-currency transactions, XLM is the digital intermediary that allows for such a transaction to occur at a low cost.

In-order to prevent DoS attacks (aka spams) that would inevitably occur on the Stellar network, a small fee of 0.00001 XLM is associated with every transaction that occurs on the network. This fee is small enough so it does not significantly affect the cost of transaction, but large enough so it dissuades bad actors from spamming the network. 

Prior to Protocol 12, Stellar had a built-in inflation mechanism conceived to allow account holders to collectively direct inflation-generated lumens toward projects built on Stellar.

As the network evolved and grew, it became increasingly clear that inflation wasn’t working as intended — account holders either didn’t set their inflation destination or joined inflation pools to claim the inflation themselves, and the operational costs associated with inflation payments continued to rise — and so a protocol change to disable inflation was proposed, implemented, voted on by validators, and ultimately adopted as part of a network upgrade.

The inflation operation is now deprecated.

WETH is the tokenized/packaged form of ETH that you use to pay for items when you interact with Ethereum dApps. WETH follows the ERC-20 token standards, enabling it to achieve interoperability with other ERC-20 tokens. 

This offers more utility to holders as they can use it across networks and dApps. You can stake, yield farm, lend, and provide liquidity to various liquidity pools with WETH. 

Also, unlike ETH, which doesn’t conform to its own ERC-20 standard and thus has lower interoperability as it can’t be used on other chains besides Ethereum, WETH can be used on cheaper and high throughput alternatives like Binance, Polygon, Solana, and Cardano.

The price of WETH will always be the same as ETH because it maintains a 1:1 wrapping ratio.

How to Wrap ETH?
Custodians wrap and unwrap ETH. To wrap ETH, you send ETH to a custodian. This can be a multi-sig wallet, a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), or a smart contract. After connecting your web3 wallet to a DeFi exchange, you enter the amount of ETH you wish to wrap and click the swap function. Once the transaction is confirmed, you will receive WETH tokens equivalent to the ETH that you’ve swapped.

On a centralized exchange, the exchange burns the deposited ETH and mints a wrapped form for you. And when you want to unwrap it, the exchange will burn the wrapped version and mint the ETH on your behalf.

What’s Next for WETH?
According to the developers, hopefully there will be no future for WETH. According to the website, steps are being taken to update ETH to make it compliant with its own ERC-20 standards. ","2016-06-17","0.0","crypto-backed tokens","ethereum","35.9","47.240286639413824","0.0","16.900000000000002","1640","3297","29.0088","0"

It was created based on the Bitcoin protocol but differs in terms of the hashing algorithm used. Litecoin uses the memory intensive Scrypt proof of work mining algorithm. Scrypt allows consumer-grade hardware such as GPU to mine those coins.

Why Litecoin?
Litecoin is a cryptocurrency that has evolved from Bitcoin after its own popularity in the industry, this alternative, or ‘altcoin’ has emerged to allow investors to diversify their digital currency package, according to Investopedia. Litecoin is one of the most prominent altcoins and was created by former Google employee and Director of Engineering at Coinbase, Charlie Lee. Litecoin was the first to alter Bitcoin and the most significant difference is that it takes 2.5 minutes for Litecoin to generate a block, or transaction, in comparison to Bitcoin's 10 minutes.

‘While this matters little to traders, miners who use hardware to run Bitcoin's network cannot switch over to Litecoin. This keeps bigger mining conglomerates away from Litecoin because they cannot easily optimize their profits by swapping to another coin, contributing to a more decentralized experience. Litecoin also has bigger blocks, and more coins in circulation, making it more affordable and swift when transacting,’ Investopedia explained.

As explained above, Litecoin can transact a lot faster than Bitcoin, but there are also a number of other characteristics that investors need to know before trading. Litecoin can handle higher volumes of transactions because of the capability of transacting faster and if Bitcoin attempted to transact on the scale of its altcoin, a code update would be needed. However, Litecoin’s blocks would be larger, but with more ‘orphaned blocks'. The faster block time of litecoin reduces the risk of double spending attacks - this is theoretical in the case of both networks having the same hashing power.

Litecoin Technical Details:
The transaction confirmation time taken for Litecoin is about 2.5 minutes on average (as compared to Bitcoin's 10 minutes). The Litecoin network is scheduled to cap at 84 million currency units. 

Litecoin has inspired many other popular alternative currencies (eg. Dogecoin) because of its Scrypt hashing algorithm in order to prevent ASIC miners from mining those coins. However it is said that by the end of this year, Scrypt ASIC will enter the mass market.","2011-10-08","65.0","smart contract platform","unknown","61.0","47.5283615116455","99.59119891890371","16.900000000000002","2447","5011","64.20106962161628","0"

Pi Network is a social cryptocurrency, developer platform, and ecosystem designed for widespread accessibility and real-world utility. It enables users to mine and transact Pi using a mobile-friendly interface while supporting applications built within its blockchain ecosystem.

Supply Model and Mining Mechanism
The Maximum Supply of Pi is 100 billion tokens. The Maximum Supply is comprised of the following: 65 Billion tokens (or 65%) are allocated for all community mining rewards; 10 billion (10%) are allocated for foundation reserves; 5 billion (5%) are allocated for liquidity purposes; and 20 billion (20%) are allocated for the Core Team. Each allocation mentioned above tracks the community Migrated Mining Rewards issuance pace, so the proportions of each allocation in the total supply remains the same at any given time. 

The Effective Total Supply of Pi—the total Pi supply at the current time—allocates Pi proportionally the same as the Maximum Supply. Since every allocation tracks the Migrated Mining Rewards of the community, the Effective Total Supply can be calculated by dividing the current Migrated Mining Rewards of Pi on the Mainnet blockchain by 65%. The other allocations within the Effective Total Supply can then be calculated based on the same proportions as the Maximum Supply, e.g. at most 10% of the Effective Total Supply is available in the foundation reserve, 5% of the Effective Total Supply is available for liquidity purposes, and 20% of the Effective Total Supply is available for the Core Team. This remains true despite the fact that all tokens were minted at the genesis as technically required by the blockchain protocol.

Circulating Supply includes all Migrated Mining Rewards and all tokens that entered circulation from other buckets of the allocations, which at its maximum could be summed up to equal the Effective Total Supply. 

Pi’s mining rewards are distributed based on an issuance formula that follows a declining exponential model defined in the Pi whitepaper. Users can increase the amount of mining rewards they receive based on their individual contributions to the network, like Security Circles, using utility-based Pi apps, running Nodes, etc. For each month, the amount of Pi to be distributed as mobile balance is capped and determined by the model, regardless of how many people or how many types of mining rewards there are during the month. The capping is achieved by the design of a system-wide base mining rate, and each type of mining rewards to each individual are just a multiplier of this base mining rate. As the monthly supplies always diminish, the base mining rate generally decreases over time. 

Fewer Pi may also be issued because the real Pi issuance on the blockchain depends on Pioneers passing KYC and completing all steps required for migration to the Mainnet. Despite all efforts to facilitate and remind Pioneers to complete those required steps, there are always dropoffs along the way, resulting in less than all outstanding mobile balances to be issued on the blockchain. Because of this mechanism, the community issued amount (Migrated Mining Rewards) on the blockchain will likely be closer and closer to a line lower than the 65 billion. This is thus the reason for the variable Effective Total Supply which incorporates this effect. Effective Total Supply results from all Migrated Mining Rewards divided by 65%, as opposed to the Maximum Supply of 100 billion.

Ecosystem and Adoption
Pi Network has built an integrated ecosystem that facilitates real-world transactions and decentralized applications. Pi can be used as a medium of exchange for goods and services, including online commerce and local brick-and-mortar businesses.

Users can engage with Core Team and community-built apps in the Pi ecosystem through the Pi Browser, where integrated features like the Pi Wallet provide a seamless experience. Events like PiFest 2024 showcased Pi’s growing adoption, with over 27,000 active sellers and 28,000 test merchants across 160 countries.

Who Are the Founders of Pi Network?
Pi Network was founded by Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis and Dr. Chengdiao Fan, both of whom have PhDs from Stanford University and a passion for improving human lives through technology.

Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis is a Stanford PhD in EE and postdoc in CS with research on distributed systems and human-computer interaction. His work focuses on combining distributed systems and human computer interaction to bring cryptocurrency to everyday people. As a strong and long-term believer of the technical, financial and social potential of cryptocurrencies, he is determined to move them beyond their current limitations and is committed to bringing the power of blockchain to more people.

Dr. Chengdiao Fan holds a Stanford PhD in Anthropological Sciences, harnessing social computing to unlock human potential on a global scale. Chengdiao is building Pi Network to mobilize individuals all over the world to participate and be rewarded for their contributions, and establish an inclusive ecosystem for global citizens to unleash and capture their own agency, and in turn create utilities and productions for society and the world.

Compliance and Identity Verification
Pi Network follows a one-account-per-person policy through its Know Your Customer (KYC) solution. This system combines machine automation and human verification to authenticate user identities while preserving privacy.

The KYC process emphasizes real individuals, combats fraudulent activities and enables fair participation in the mining process of the network. Pi’s identity verification approach balances scalability, security, and accessibility, allowing millions of users worldwide to validate their accounts while maintaining regulatory compliance.","","87.86","layer 1 (l1)","unknown","54.300000000000004","40.888061267305105","99.0898965899809","16.900000000000002","5842","0","50.60631380649331","0"

Machine learning models train collaboratively and are rewarded in TAO according to the informational value they offer the collective. TAO also grants external access, allowing users to extract information from the network while tuning its activities to their needs.

Ultimately, BitTensors vision is to create a pure market for artificial intelligence, an incentivized arena in which consumers and producers of this valuable commodity can interact in a trustless, open and transparent context.

Bittensor enables:

-A novel, optimized strategy for the development and distribution of artificial intelligence technology by leveraging the possibilities of a distributed ledger. Specifically, its facilitation of open access/ownership, decentralized governance, and the ability to harness globally-distributed resources of computing power and innovation within an incentivized framework.

-An open-source repository of machine intelligence, accessible to anyone, anywhere, thus creating the conditions for open and permission-less innovation on a global internet scale.

-Distribution of rewards and network ownership to users in direct proportion to the value they have added.","","80.0","artificial intelligence (ai)","unknown","98.8","39.834293319325624","98.34262097753383","37.3","1293","0","55.42234234213683","0"

Built by the DFINITY Foundation, IC aims to recreate the web by supporting smart contract development at scale and changing the way people can interact using web services. Internet Computer aims to extend the public internet, so that it can be the world’s computing platform, in a decentralized manner. Internet Computer sets to revolutionalize the design of the crypto economy, with an aim to overhaul traditional software services. 

The project was founded in October 2016 by Dominic WIllams and have raised a total of $121 million from investors such as Adreessen Horowitz, Polychain Capital, Multicoin Capital and such. On May 10, 2021, DFINITY launched the Internet Computer into the public domain, marking it a major milestone for ICP as it means the internet now functions as a decentralised global computer. This is marked by the release of all of the Internet Computer’s source code into the public domain, as well as ICP utility token that allows tens of thousands of community members to govern the Internet Computer network.

ICP is Internet Computer's native token. It plays three prominent roles:

1. Network Governance: Users that participate in the governance will be rewarded with ICPI
2. Production of Cycles for Compute: ICP can be converted into cycles where it is used as the transaction fee to access the network. Cycles are burned after used.
3. Rewarding Users: ICP is used as the rewards to incentivize users to participate in the network such as securing the network.","","76.47","artificial intelligence (ai)","internet-computer","98.3","43.63461370547873","98.46403565665707","38.1","1626","0","55.67098747982997","0"

This generalization of Nakamoto consensus allows for secure operation while maintaining very high block rates (currently one block per second, aiming for 10/sec, dreaming of 100/sec) and minuscule confirmation times dominated by internet latency (cf. chapter 6 of the the paper for some initial benchmarks). The Kaspa implementation includes a lot of cool features and subprotocols including Reachability to query the DAG's topology, Block data pruning (with near-future plans for block header pruning), SPV proofs, and later subnetwork support which will make future implementation of layer 2 solutions much easier.","","80.0","smart contract platform","unknown","99.0","46.28001685575503","97.54148919258209","46.1","956","0","57.32957121740373","0"

FTN is the native coin of Bahamut - public, layer 1 EVM-based blockchain solution with a novelty consensus - PoSA. PoSA stands for Proof of Stake and Activity, where Activity is represented by the amount of gas spent by users when interacting with a validator-deployed smart contract. The more gas usage the given smart contract has, the more chances for the validator-deployer to become a block producer in future epochs.

What makes your project unique?
The main unique aspect of Bahamut is the PoSA consensus, which introduces new ways for businesses to monetize their user base, while preserving the integrity and transparency of the web3 space. 

History of your project.
FTN was originally an ERC20 token of SoftConstruct and Fastex ecosystems. After Bahamut mainnet launched on May 3, 2023 with FTN as its native coin, the migration process started from Ethereum to Bahamut and is still an ongoing process. 

What’s next for your project?
The infrastructure of Bahamut is constantly growing - users can expect decentralized exchanges, various apps, bridge services, and other essential aspects to be available on Bahamut before the end of the year. Also, Bahamut grant program is under way and will open the doors to everyone who wants to build a better decentralized future together.

What can your token be used for?
FTN is used in a variety of providers as a gaming token, and also the native coin for Bahamut network.

Some zones act as hubs with respect to other zones, allowing many zones to interoperate through a shared hub. The architecture is a more general application of the Bitcoin sidechains concept, using classic BFT and Proof-of-Stake algorithms, instead of Proof-of-Work.Cosmos can interoperate with multiple other applications and cryptocurrencies, something other blockchains can’t do well. By creating a new zone, you can plug any blockchain system into the Cosmos hub and pass tokens back and forth between those zones, without the need for an intermediary.

While the Cosmos Hub is a multi-asset distributed ledger, there is a special native token called the atom. Atoms have three use cases: as a spam-prevention mechanism, as staking tokens, and as a voting mechanism in governance.

As a spam prevention mechanism, Atoms are used to pay fees. The fee may be proportional to the amount of computation required by the transaction, similar to Ethereum’s concept of “gas”. Fee distribution is done in-protocol and a protocol specification is described here.

As staking tokens, Atoms can be “bonded” in order to earn block rewards. The economic security of the Cosmos Hub is a function of the amount of Atoms staked. The more Atoms that are collateralized, the more “skin” there is at stake and the higher the cost of attacking the network. Thus, the more Atoms there are bonded, the greater the economic security of the network.

Atom holders may govern the Cosmos Hub by voting on proposals with their staked Atoms.","","77.78","smart contract platform","cosmos","98.7","44.119183499155376","98.64961166093389","40.5","1743","0","56.338489081326856","0"

First Digital USD (FDUSD) aim to revolutionize the digital asset landscape. Our mission is to empower users with a transformative financial instrument that combines the stability of cash reserves with the seamless efficiency of advanced blockchain technology. By offering a fully collateralized digital asset, our stablecoin ensures the utmost security, transparency, and transaction reliability. This strategic fusion of traditional stability and cutting-edge innovation allows users to confidently navigate the digital economy, unlocking a world of possibilities while maintaining the utmost trust in their financial interactions.

What makes your project unique?
Transferable: FDUSD enables frictionless and streamlined transactions, rendering it a convenient choice for a wide range of applications and scenarios.

Redeemable: FDUSD is backed by high-quality reserves- cash and cash equivalents, which enable holders the ability to redeem their FDUSD tokens for their equivalent value in US dollars. Users can trust that FDUSD is always 1:1 backed. 

Low Fees: One notable benefit of FDUSD is its ability to offer cost-effective transactions with minimal fees. Unlike traditional financial transactions, this cost-efficiency makes FDUSD an attractive and economical choice for users.

Operates on Decentralized Networks. 
FDUSD operates on decentralized networks that are distributed across multiple nodes. In so doing, it enhances transparency, security, and resilience. 

Bankruptcy Remote 
FDUSD is designed to be bankruptcy remote, with the reserves held in segregated accounts on a registered trust company, separated from the issuer’s operational accounts. It ensures the stablecoin remains stable and secure.

History of your project.
Established in 2019, First Digital is Asia’s leading multi-faceted trust partner bridging the gap between the traditional and digital financial worlds.

A key component of the Worldcoin project is the development of the foundational infrastructure that will be important for a world where AI plays an increasingly large role.

The Worldcoin system revolves around World ID, a privacy-preserving global identity network. World ID enables users to verify their humanness online while maintaining their privacy through zero-knowledge proofs.

Using World ID, individuals will be able to prove that they are a real, unique human to any platform that integrates with the protocol, including to web3 systems, social networking sites, and governmental programs. This will enable fair airdrops or token/NFT sales, provide protection against bots/sybil attacks on social media, and enable the fairer distribution of limited governmental resources. Furthermore, World ID can also enable global democratic processes and novel forms of governance (e.g., via quadratic voting), and it may eventually show a path to AI-funded UBI. The Worldcoin token (WLD), alongside World ID, will let users participate in governing the Worldcoin protocol. 

To engage with the Worldcoin protocol, individuals must first download a first wallet app that supports the creation of a World ID. Users visit a physical imaging device called the Orb to get their World ID Orb-verified. Orbs are operated by a network of independent local businesses called Orb Operators. The Orb uses multispectral sensors to verify humanness and uniqueness to issue an Orb-verified World ID, with all images being promptly deleted on-device per default (absent explicit consent to Data Custody). All Orb-verified World IDs holders are entitled to claim recurring grants of free WLD tokens, subject to certain availability restrictions. The WLD token is designed as a utility token with governance properties.

What’s unique about KuCoin is that they share 50% of their overall trading fee revenue with users holding their exchange-based token. In a similar fashion to Binance, KuCoin offers relatively low tradings fees and incentives for holding (or trading) its native cryptocurrency. Back in 2011, the founders started researching blockchain tech and went further to build the technical architecture for KuCoin in 2013. 4 years later, the exchange launched with the ultimate goal of “becoming one of the top 10 worldwide hottest exchange platform[s]” by 2019.

As stated on their official website which lists 12 core members, “Kucoin aims at providing users digital asset transaction and exchange services which are even more safe and convenient, integrating premium assets worldwide, and constructing state of the art transaction platform”. CEO and founder, Michael Gam, is a former technical expert at Ant Financial, an affiliate company of the Chinese Alibaba Group. He was also a senior partner at Internet giants like MikeCRM and KF5.COM. OO, Eric Don, is referred to as a “senior Internet researcher, systems architect, and Internet industry star”. He is also stated to be the CTO and senior partner of IT companies including YOULIN.COM, KITEME, and REINOT. However, it’s unclear if these websites actually exist as they did not show in a Google search or when entering the website domains.  According to his LinkedIn, he is currently CTO at Youlin Network Technologies, yet there is no mention of KITEME or REINOT.

With its growing user base and increasing number of cryptocurrencies being offered, KuCoin may be set up for a strong run in the markets. KuCoin Shares volume is expected to grow as the daily trading volume on KuCoin, hence, trading fees collection grows &amp; thus, the size of dividend payout grows. This can lure investors to hold KCS token which may even increase its value. KuCoin faces stiff competition from OKEx, but it expects to continue to grow its community exponentially as it is being projected to be one among the top 5 exchanges in the world.

## What is Flare (FLR)?

Flare is an EVM-based Layer 1 blockchain designed to allow developers to build applications that are interoperable with blockchains and the internet. By providing decentralized access to high-integrity data, Flare enables new use cases and monetisation models.


## What makes Flare unique?

Flare's native interoperability protocols, the State Connector and the FTSO are secured by the network itself, allowing it to reliably deliver data from a wide variety of off-chain sources in a decentralized way. 

The Flare Time Series Oracle delivers highly-decentralized price and data feeds to dapps on Flare, without relying on centralized providers. 

The State Connector protocols enable information, both from other blockchains and the internet to be used securely, scalably and trustlessly with smart contracts on Flare.

Risk is minimized by building this decentralized data infrastructure natively into the blockchain, powered by a large number of independent data providers.

By incentivizing sets of independent providers to query, acquire, and process data without relying on single, centralized sources, Flare’s core protocols can facilitate the development of interoperable dapps with a broad range of potential innovative use cases.


## What is the Flare (FLR) token used for?

FLR is the native token used for payments, transaction fees to prevent spam attacks and staking in validator nodes. FLR can also be wrapped into an ERC-20 variant, WFLR. WFLR tokens serve various functions; they can be delegated to FTSO data providers, for example, or staked to participate in governance. These two uses are not mutually exclusive and do not prevent the tokens from being used in other EVM-compatible dapps and smart contracts on Flare.

Wrapped FLR (WFLR) can be minted by depositing native FLR tokens into a smart contract and withdrawing the newly minted","","90.91","smart contract platform","unknown","83.89999999999999","45.47373094755562","0.0","44.3","2024","0","22.766000000000002","0"

While OP Mainnet was the first, many prominent chains now run on the Optimism’s OP Stack, including Base (by Coinbase), Unichain (by Uniswap), Ink (by Kraken), and World Chain (by Worldcoin). The OP Stack has become the leading framework for Ethereum Layer 2 chains, powering the majority of L2 activity today.
Every OP Chain in the Superchain contributes back to the Optimism Collectiv and all chains follow a standardized revenue-sharing model: the greater of 2.5% of total chain revenue or 15% of onchain profit (defined as fees minus L1 gas costs) is paid back to the Optimism.
By aligning economic incentives across many chains, Optimism transforms Ethereum scaling into a sustainable flywheel by delivering fast, low-cost transactions while reinvesting in the future of the ecosystem.

Anyone who owns PAXG has ownership rights to that gold under the custody of Paxos Trust Company. Since PAXG represents physical gold, its value is tied directly to the real-time market value of that physical gold.

PAXG gives customers the benefits of actual physical ownership of specific gold bars with the speed and mobility of a digital asset. Customers are able to have fractional ownership of physical bars. On the Paxos platform, customers can convert their tokens to allocated gold, unallocated gold, or fiat currency (and vice versa) quickly and efficiently, reducing their exposure to settlement risk. PAXG is also available for trading on Paxos’ itBit exchange. PAXG will also be available on other crypto-asset exchanges, wallets, lending platforms and elsewhere within the crypto ecosystem.

The Graph Network makes it possible to build serverless dApps that run entirely on public infrastructure.

GRT is the native token of the network that’s used to coordinate work. GRT is an ERC20 token. Node operators, called Indexers, stake and earn GRT for processing queries. Anyone can delegate GRT to Indexers to secure the network and earn rewards. Curators organize data on The Graph by signaling GRT on useful APIs, called subgraphs. Indexers, Delegators, and Curators work together to organize the data for the crypto economy and maintain a useful global API for DeFi and Web3.

The significant majority of this portfolio is held in the iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ: SHV). There is also a small portion of USDC and USD for liquidity purposes.
OUSG brings exposure to the ‘risk-free’ US Treasury rate on-chain for the first time. OUSG is an investment option that delivers a stable and predictable return while offering deep liquidity. Ondo funds such as OUSG only ever invest into ETFs backed by secure, stable, and liquid securities; these are the same assets in which trillions of dollars are invested every day by the world's largest institutions.
OUSG was developed alongside two other fund tokens, OSTB and OHYG, by Ondo Finance, a software development firm in DeFi. Ondo launched in August 2021. Its first product was Ondo Vaults, a structured finance protocol on Ethereum. Later that year, Ondo launched Liquidity-as-a-Service (LaaS), facilitating over $210M in total liquidity provided.

As DeFi yields compressed in 2022, the Ondo team decided to sunset Vaults and LaaS (together, ""Ondo V1"") to focus on next-generation protocols. Ondo V2, including Ondo’s tokenized funds, were announced by Nathan Allman in January 2023. Ondo funds subsequently opened to subscriptions soon after. 

What can OUSG be Used For?
For investors who pass KYC and AML screening and sign subscription documents, OUSG tokens represent ownership in the fund. Investors can transfer these tokens between each other to effect changes in fund ownership. Investors can also use smart contracts to facilitate their financial arrangements such as by engaging in lending and trading activities with each other. 

The tokens themselves have transfer restrictions that will ensure they do not end up in the hands of anyone not appropriately qualified as an investor in the fund.","","","tokenized assets","ethereum","1.3","50.1020640647872","0.0","16.900000000000002","1928","0","15.9139","0"

Unlike Uniswap, its main focus is only to swap between assets that are supposed to have the same value. This is useful in the DeFi ecosystem as there are plenty of wrapped tokens and synthetic tokens that aim to mimic the price of the real underlying asset. 

For example, one of the biggest pools is 3CRV, which is a stablecoin pool consisting of DAI, USDT, and USDC. Their ratio in the pool will be based on the supply and demand of the market. Depositing a coin with a lesser ratio will yield the user a higher percentage of the pool. As such when the ratio is heavily tilted to one of the coins, it may serve as a good chance to arbitrage.

Curve Finance also supports yield-bearing tokens. For example, it collaborated with Yearn Finance to release yUSD pools that consisted of yDAI, yUSDT, yUSDC and yTUSD. Users that participated in this pool will not only have yield from the underlying yield-bearing tokens, but also the swap fees generated by the Curve pool. Including the yield farming rewards in terms of CRV tokens, liquidity providers of the pool actually have three sources of yield. ","","85.71","decentralized exchange (dex)","ethereum","98.2","34.428246309907145","98.383618582072","46.800000000000004","1208","0","57.809066503725205","0"

Jito Network is a major contributor to the Solana ecosystem through its JitoSOL liquid staking pool, and its collection of MEV products. Users can exchange their SOL for JitoSOL. In return, holders maintain SOL’s liquidity and DeFi opportunities while earning yield from staking. JitoSOL uniquely provides its holders with additional rewards from transaction revenue associated with MEV extraction on Solana. Maximum extractable value (MEV) describes profit opportunities attributable to the specific order of transaction execution. For example, a large swap on Orca can lower the pool’s price below that of Raydium or Serum. Traders will race to profit from that price difference and this arbitrage is considered MEV. The Jito Foundation was created to minimize the negative impacts of MEV, equitably distribute the profits and increase transparency. Jito published an open source validator client designed to create a competitive market for MEV extraction. The client enables auctions within each block for the opportunity to capture that block’s MEV. Traders submit bids, and the highest bidders within each block can harvest available MEV.","","25.0","decentralized finance (defi)","solana","75.8","41.41558508649688","0.0","40.0","1192","0","21.674350000000004","0"

It can be viewed as a ""dual network"" consisting of two complementary subsystems, the Theta Edge Network and the Theta Blockchain. The edge network provides vast amounts of GPU compute power for AI, video, rendering and other tasks, while the Theta blockchain provides payment, reward, and smart contract capabilities. Below we provide more details for the two components.

Theta's Edge Network is a decentralized network consisting of over 10,000 active global nodes with 80 PetaFLOPS of always available distributed GPU compute power, equivalent to 250 Nvidia A100s. Theta Edge Network powers the Theta EdgeCloud, a leading hybrid cloud-edge AI computing platform launched on May 1, 2024. Leveraging Theta's recently approved patent on ‘Edge Computing Platform supported by Smart Contract Enabled Blockchain Network’ and the upcoming release of Elite+ Booster edge nodes, all Theta community members will be able to participate and share in the rewards from EdgeCloud AI, video, 3D rendering and gaming compute jobs. While chatbots like ChatGPT and others utilize GPUs, new generative AI models such as text-to-video, text-to-3D and sketch-to-3D will require 10-100x the amount of computational power. The combined GPU compute power of Theta's decentralized edge network and its preferred cloud partners is 20-30x more than other comparable networks in the industry today, holding the keys to global GPU compute, arguably the most valuable and most disruptive asset in history.

Theta blockchain is an EVM compatible multi-blockchain network which supports Turing complete smart contracts. This EVM support enables a wide range of interesting Web3 applications to be built on the Theta Network. Examples include non-fungible tokens (NFT), decentralized exchanges (DEX/DeFi), and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO), which could become indispensable building blocks of the next generation AI, media and entertainment platforms. Theta’s enterprise validator and governance council is led by Google, Samsung, Sony, Creative Artists Agency (CAA), Binance, Blockchain Ventures, DHVC, gumi and other global leaders. Theta has partnered with leading entertainment brands including Lionsgate, MGM, Katy Perry, American Idol, The Price is Right, Taste of Home, and more. Popular platforms utilizing Theta’s Web3 infrastructure include MetaCannes Film3 Festival, FuseTV, CONtv Anime, WPT, PetCollective, FailArmy, and other OTT streaming services. Strategic corporate investors include Samsung NEXT, Sony Innovation Fund, Bertelsmann Digital Media Investments (BDMI), CAA and Silicon Valley VCs including DCM and Sierra Ventures.","2017-12-14","75.0","smart contract platform","unknown","94.8","42.51460752641237","96.5467271170782","45.300000000000004","2734","2752","68.98655449097737","0"

Zcash payments are published on a public blockchain, but the sender, recipient, and amount of a transaction remain private.

Zcash is based on peer-reviewed cryptographic research, and built by a security-specialized engineering team on an open source platform based on Bitcoin Core's battle-tested codebase. Our improvement over Bitcoin is the addition of privacy. Zcash uses advanced cryptographic techniques, namely zero-knowledge proofs, to guarantee the validity of transactions without revealing additional information about them.

How Zcash works

Zcash encrypts the contents of shielded transactions. Since the payment information is encrypted, the protocol uses a novel cryptographic method to verify their validity.

Zcash uses a zero-knowledge proof construction called a zk-SNARK, developed by our team of experienced cryptographers based on recent breakthroughs in cryptography. These constructions allow the network to maintain a secure ledger of balances without disclosing the parties or amounts involved. Instead of publicly demonstrating spend-authority and transaction values, the transaction metadata is encrypted and zk-SNARKs are used to prove that nobody is cheating or stealing.

Zcash also enables users to send public payments which work similarly to Bitcoin. With the support for both shielded and transparent addresses, users can choose to send Zcash privately or publicly. Zcash payments sent from a shielded address to a transparent address reveal the received balance, while payments from a transparent address to a shielded address protect the receiving value.

The goal of Bitcoin SV is to fulfil the original vision of the Bitcoin protocol and design as described in Satoshi Nakamoto’s white paper, early Bitcoin client software and known Satoshi writings. BSV aims to offer scalability and stability in line with the original description of Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, as well as deliver a distributed data network that can support enterprise-level advanced blockchain applications. To this end, it has removed artificial block size limits and re-enabled Script commands and other technical capabilities which had been historically disabled or restricted by the protocol developers of the BTC blockchain. This allows the network to process tens of thousands of transactions per second while maintaining extremely low transaction fees for micropayments, in addition to offering advanced capabilities such as tokens, smart contracts, computation and other data use cases. The BSV network is unique in its capacity for unbounded on-chain scaling while also being more aligned with the original design of Bitcoin than any other blockchain.","","66.67","smart contract platform","unknown","37.2","43.98737085579274","98.05904946316276","16.900000000000002","1256","0","50.22189231210697","0"

ENS’s job is to map human-readable names like ‘alice.eth’ to machine-readable identifiers such as Ethereum addresses, other cryptocurrency addresses, content hashes, and metadata. ENS also supports ‘reverse resolution’, making it possible to associate metadata such as canonical names or interface descriptions with Ethereum addresses.

ENS has similar goals to DNS, the Internet’s Domain Name Service, but has significantly different architecture due to the capabilities and constraints provided by the Ethereum blockchain. Like DNS, ENS operates on a system of dot-separated hierarchical names called domains, with the owner of a domain having full control over subdomains.

Top-level domains, like ‘.eth’ and ‘.test’, are owned by smart contracts called registrars, which specify rules governing the allocation of their subdomains. Anyone may, by following the rules imposed by these registrar contracts, obtain ownership of a domain for their own use. ENS also supports importing in DNS names already owned by the user for use on ENS.

Because of the hierarchal nature of ENS, anyone who owns a domain at any level may configure subdomains - for themselves or others - as desired. For instance, if Alice owns 'alice.eth', she can create 'pay.alice.eth' and configure it as she wishes.

ENS is deployed on the Ethereum main network and on several test networks. If you use a library such as the ensjs Javascript library, or an end-user application, it will automatically detect the network you are interacting with and use the ENS deployment on that network.","","100.0","nft","ethereum","28.799999999999997","42.77998946889722","0.0","16.900000000000002","1691","0","15.909699999999999","0"

IOTA is initially focused on serving as the backbone of the Internet-of-Things (IoT).

IOTA is a cryptocurrency that has no transaction fees and requires no miners in order to process transactions. It does, however, require some computational power to submit a transaction, making it perfect for machines to use as a currency and distributed communication protocol for the Internet of Things “IoT”. The main purpose of IOTA is to solve some of the major problems with Blockchain technology, the main one being that the bigger the Blockchain (such as Bitcoin), the slower, more expensive, and also more restricting it is to actually transfer funds. Another issue with the Blockchain is size, as more and more Blocks are added, the longer the Blockchain gets, and therefore the less amount of computers are able to mine it. Right now BTC is over 150GB long, and so is ETH. If this size increased tenfold, very few computers would be able to mine it at all. Making them relatively centralized (the top 2 Bitcoin mining pools own about 56% of hashing power).

tBTC allows you to unlock your Bitcoin’s value to borrow and lend, mint stablecoins, provide liquidity, and much more.

tBTC is a decentralized wrapped Bitcoin that is 1:1 backed by main-net BTC. Existing solutions bringing Bitcoin to Ethereum require you to send your Bitcoin to an intermediary, who then issues you an Ethereum token representing your original asset. 

This centralized model requires you to trust a third party and is prone to censorship, sacrificing Bitcoin's promise of secure, permissionless decentralization.

How does tBTC solve this issue?
Instead of centralized intermediaries, tBTC uses a randomly selected group of operators running nodes on the Threshold Network to secure deposited Bitcoin through threshold cryptography. 

That means tBTC requires a threshold majority agreement before operators perform any action with your Bitcoin. By rotating the selection of operators weekly, tBTC protects against any individual or group of operators colluding to fraudulently seize the underlying deposits. 

By relying on an honest-majority-assumption, we can calculate the likelihood any wallet comprised of a quorum of dishonest operators. An insurance backstop (the coverage pools), serves as an emergency fallback in the event a wallet is compromised.

What is Threshold Network?
Threshold.network stems from the merger of NuCypher and Keep networks into a single decentralized network — it delivers a suite of threshold cryptography services for web3 applications through a decentralized network of staking nodes. The whole community is governed by a DAO.

Flagship services of Threshold Network include Threshold Access Control (TACo) – which enables end-to-end encrypted data sharing and communication without the need to trust a centralized authority, tBTC v2 - the only decentralized and permissionless Bitcoin-to-Ethereum asset bridge and thUSD - an overcollateralized and decentralized USD stablecoin that uses both ETH and tBTC as collateral.","","","crypto-backed tokens","ethereum","88.3","50.57947721698949","94.42282646354468","41.099999999999994","2007","0","55.01353926224063","0"

Tezos is a high-performing blockchain and open-source platform for assets and applications, with a strong focus on code security, on-chain governance, and decentralization. Tezos 2.0, the upcoming step in the evolution of Tezos, aims to improve scalability (via layer 2s), composability, and to implement support to mainstream programming languages (like Javascript, Typescript, Python, and many others).


Initially built with formal verification in mind, the Tezos protocol enables builders to avoid bugs when developing smart contracts, making it particularly suited to applications that require a high degree of security and certainty.


Tezos’ LPoS (Liquid Proof-of-Stake) consensus mechanism enables any stakeholder to take part, directly or by delegation, in the consensus process, and to be rewarded for securing the network. Rather uniquely, Tezos’ on-chain governance system also enables stakeholders to create and vote on protocol upgrade proposals. This pioneering system allows the protocol to self-amend and upgrade itself without leading to a split (or fork) in the blockchain, empowering the community without slowing down innovation.


First proposed in 2014 and launched in 2018, the Tezos Mainnet has a proven track record of running uninterrupted ever since, having earned a strong reputation for technical excellence and a supportive community. 


Who Are the Founders of Tezos?
Tezos was conceived by Arthur and Kathleen Breitman in a 2014 white paper under the pseudonym L.M. Goodman in a nod to Satoshi Nakamoto, referencing a journalist who had misidentified the creator of Bitcoin.


In a previous paper, the Breitmans had argued that Bitcoin's biggest shortcomings were the lack of a governance process that invited contributions from its community of users, cost and centralization issues raised by its proof-of-work system, the limited expressiveness of its programming language which didn’t allow for smart contracts, and security ","","100.0","smart contract platform","unknown","25.5","44.78538534685233","0.0","16.900000000000002","2003","0","15.915399999999998","0"

Users stake ETH with mETH Protocol and receive yield-bearing $mETH, and unstake $mETH to receive the underlying principal staked ETH and accumulated rewards. 

Since the inception of mETH Protocol, Mantle's mission has been to deliver the most user-friendly and rewarding $mETH experience. Thanks to ecosystem-wide adoption, $mETH users are able to trade on Mantle DEXs, earn yield by providing liquidity to $mETH liquidity pools, and generate yield within decentralized money markets. With $mETH's increasing adoption and composability within Mantle Ecosystem dApps, the protocol now ranks as the fourth largest ETH LSP by TVL. The introduction of $cmETH, a permissionless, composable liquid restaking token that unlocks restaking opportunities on Mantle, and $COOK, the protocol's upcoming governance token, mETH Protocol enters its next phase with further enhanced offerings. Through these features, mETH Protocol provides its users with capital efficiency, convenience, and a wide range of yield-bearing opportunities within Mantle Ecosystem dApps, all in a design that has been created to maximize security with non-custodial core smart contracts and off-chain services that enforce sanity bounds and risk limits.","","","ethereum ecosystem","ethereum","88.6","47.033544774204934","0.0","76.6","1537","0","30.83215","0"

Dog is secured by the Bitcoin blockchain and exists on Bitcoin L1, marking a significant innovation compared to Bitcoin with just BTC. Dog is a Bitcoin Runes token with a minimal on-chain footprint, native to Bitcoin, and stored in UTXOs, just like Bitcoin.


What is the project about?

Dog does not do any paid promotion and is fully decentralized just like Bitcoin. Every influencer who chooses to post about Dog either received the airdrop or bought on secondary. Dog leverages the CC0 license to ensure that Dog is not owned by any single entity but rather by everyone. This had lead to the ""DOG Army"" independently creating art, apps, lotteries, plushies, websites, podcast, magazines, X account, IRL meetups, clothing lines, PFP collections, Telegram groups, and TikTok/Instagram about Dog.

What makes your project unique?

Dog was airdropped in the fairest memecoin launch ever. In early 2024, the Bitcoin Ordinals ecosystem came together in a full volunteer initiative that rewarded early adopters of the Ordinals Protocol. There was no team allocation, and 100% of the supply was airdropped for free. The airdrop algorithm favored neither whales nor influencers; it was determined by the community and made open-source for maximum transparency.","","91.67","solana ecosystem","ordinals","26.6","98.74907740441428","0.0","16.900000000000002","1419","0","15.905050000000001","1"

BDX is an ecosystem coin that facilitates confidential transactions. 
Beldex's mission is to provide a confidential environment where data can be exchanged securely. The project is focused on individual safety and true data confidentiality with systematic research to ensure the confidentiality of individual transactions, and thus the safety of users and the security of their funds. 
BDX operates on the Beldex decentralized blockchain for performing secure transactions, while the ecosystem supports secure and confidential dApps, among them: BChat, BelNet, Beldex Browser, the Beldex protocol, and the Beldex bridge. Initially, Beldex was developed on a PoW architecture followed by a transition to the PoS consensus model in order to increase the scalability of the BDX token, lower fees and reduce transaction times.","","100.0","artificial intelligence (ai)","unknown","88.1","48.46343717411742","83.6077599586616","60.0","1102","0","55.933315985531564","0"

At its core, the project leverages an AI agent capable of executing trades across multiple blockchain networks, making it a pioneer in cross-chain AI trading. Unlike typical trading bots, this AI agent not only focuses on profitability but also strategically reinvests gains into the project’s treasury to ensure sustainable growth and support ongoing initiatives.

One of YellowCatDAO’s standout features is its innovative ShameFi mechanic, introduced during its presale. This mechanism brings a new level of accountability to the crypto space by publicly exposing the actions of presale participants. It ensures transparency and discourages harmful practices such as early dumping by presalers, thereby fostering a fairer and more stable ecosystem. This unique approach aligns with the project’s ethos of transparency and trust, making it one of the few projects actively addressing the challenges of launch-stage tokenomics.

The project also offers a real-time transparency dashboard, which allows community members to monitor key activities such as token movements, and sell-offs by major wallets. This feature empowers the community with actionable insights, helping investors make informed decisions while keeping the project’s operations in check. This level of openness is rare in the crypto space and is a testament to YellowCatDAO’s commitment to building trust within its community.

Additionally, YellowCatDAO seamlessly blends entertainment with functionality by introducing elements of EntertainmentFi. Through creative community engagement, such as raffles and interactive events, the project adds a layer of fun and inclusivity to its otherwise utility-driven model. These activities not only strengthen community bonds but also contribute to the project’s treasury, creating a self-reinforcing growth cycle.

YellowCatDAO’s ability to integrate transparency, innovative tokenomics, AI-driven trading, and community interaction into one cohesive ecosystem makes it a truly unique project. By addressing pain points such as presale accountability, lack of transparency, and uninspired utility, it sets a new standard for decentralized autonomous organizations. With its bold vision and practical solutions, YellowCatDAO offers a fresh perspective on how blockchain technology can be leveraged for innovation, sustainability, and community empowerment.","","100.0","avalanche ecosystem","avalanche","24.7","44.979982887351916","0.0","16.900000000000002","2507","0","15.9196","0"

What is NEO?
NEO uses a smart economy approach to implement its distributed network concept. Its main objective is to digitize assets using the decentralized network of blockchain technology and digital identity.

Neo’s main aim is to be the distributed network for “smart economy”.  As their website states: ""Digital Assets + Digital Identity + Smart Contract = Smart Economy."" Neo was developed by Shanghai-based blockchain R&amp;D company “OnChain” and funded by two crowdsales: first crowdsale on October 2015 sold 17.5 million NEO tokens for $550,000 and the second crowdsale sold the remaining 22.5 million NEO tokens for $4.5 million.

So why NEO?
Asset digitization and identity on the NEO platform essentially creates a novel way for asset registration, issuance, and circulation. This means that tangible assets like real estate, company shares or even fiat money can be digitized and traded on the NEO network, thus giving rise to a whole new economy.

Its digital identity system allows for integration between the platform and the real world economy. It has custom digital identity standards that enable the creation of electronic identity data for individuals, organizations and even entities. These electronic systems use multi-layered authentication models that include facial and voice recognition as well as fingerprints.

All digital assets on the platform enjoy legal protection thanks to the use of digital certificates on its public blockchain. This, in turn, guarantees trust as the system offers an indelible and unalterable record of all entities’ holdings.","2016-10-17","100.0","smart contract platform","unknown","40.2","43.3706385901057","99.40086233433433","16.900000000000002","1775","3175","63.75202681701702","0"

This hybrid consensus integration gives it unique properties for a Bitcoin-like chain, such as interoperability, staking rewards, real-time processing, and an improved overall extensibility, which is hard to achieve in a completely trustless manner using only Nakamoto consensus.

MultiversX is a blockchain protocol that offers true horizontal scalability by using all aspects of sharding (Network, Transaction & State). The project describes itself as a technology ecosystem for the new internet, which includes decentralized finance, real world assets and the Metaverse. Its smart contracts execution platform is reportedly capable of up to 100,000 transactions per second, 6-second latency and a $0.002 transaction cost. MultiversX is governed and secured through the EGLD token. EGLD, or Electronic Gold, is MultiversX's native token. It acts as a store of value currency to pay for network usage. The coin also serves as a medium of exchange between platform users and validators. Users pay transaction fees in EGLD and validators participate in the consensus process. EGLD allows developers to deploy smart contracts, protocols, and dApps on the platform. It empowers participants to perform any network action. Through staking and validation rewards, as well as transaction fees, EGLD manages the MultiversX network. Plus, EGLD is endowed with the functionality of a governance token, so its holders can vote on network decisions. 

How does MultiversX Work 

According to the MultiversX crypto team, the project implements three types of parallelization: state, transactions, and network, using the parallel processing method to speed up the time and increase the number of transactions. MultiversX uses Adaptive State Sharding to scale while sharing infrastructure to support a growing number of applications/transactions on the ledger. A variation of the traditional PoS operational protocol guarantees the connection to the platform of all sections of the network, separated during sharding. Hence, the integrated environment is involved in the development of dApps, which are imitations of products and services. MultiversX combines three sharding methods to create its own unique adaptive one. It divides the network into four shards: three being execution shards that process transactions, validating 30,000 transactions per second, and Metachain is the fourth shard that coordinates and completes transactions. Sharding types include: State sharding where the history of the network, or state, is distributed across different sections of the network, or shards. Segments have their own ledger, nodes store the state of each segment; Transaction sharding where transactions are mapped to segments and processed, segments process transactions in parallel and nodes capture the state of the entire network; Network sharding where the nodes are grouped into segments and then processed. Network slicing contributes to optimizing communications. 

What makes MultiversX Unique 

MultiversX describes itself as a blockchain platform for the new internet economy, decentralized applications and enterprise use. Its main selling point is its high scalability, stating that it is the first blockchain network in which state, network and transaction sharding have all been implemented. According to its economics paper, it seeks to build up its ecosystem and establish EGLD as a store-of-value asset. To achieve this goal, the network runs on 3,200 validator nodes split into four shards: three execution shards, capable of up to 100,000 transactions per second in total, and one coordination shard, the ""Metachain."" MultiversX's adaptive state sharding architecture completely shards state, transactions and network. It can scale by adding additional shards when the throughput demand requires. It was tested to run 263,000 TPS in a public environment with 1,500 nodes from 29 countries grouped in 50 shards. To increase adoption, the blockchain also supports developers building on the platform, allowing them to earn 30% of the smart contract fees as royalties.

Reserve Rights (RSR) is an ERC-20 token that serves two main purposes for the Reserve protocol: overcollateralization of Reserve stablecoins (RTokens) through staking and governing them through proposing & voting on changes to their configuration.

The Reserve Rights (RSR) token was launched in May 2019 following a successful initial exchange offering IEO on the Huobi Prime platform.


What is Reserve Rights (RSR) used for?

Besides being the governance token for Reserve stablecoins (RTokens), by which changes to RTokens can be proposed & voted for with RSR, Reserve Rights exists as a backstop to make Reserve stablecoin (RToken) holders whole in the unlikely event of a collateral token default. In order for RSR holders to provide this overcollateralization, they can decide to stake on any one RToken, or divide their RSR tokens by staking on multiple RTokens. RSR holders can also decide not to stake their RSR at all.

In return for providing this first-loss capital, RSR stakers can expect to receive a portion of the revenue the RToken they stake on makes. As a general rule, RSR stakers can expect higher returns (APYs) the bigger the market cap of the RToken they stake on becomes.

In contrast with the “staking” you see in a lot of other projects these days, RSR staking is built to last. In Reserve’s model, late participants do not pay for early participants, nor is a trust in staking of other parties required.

For more detailed information on RSR staking, please refer to the RSR staking section in the protocol documentation: https://reserve.org/protocol/reserve_rights_rsr/#reserve-rights-staking.

Who are the founders of Reserve?

Reserve was co-founded by Nevin Freeman and Matt Elder. Freeman is a seasoned entrepreneur. He describes his life goal as ""solving the coordination problems that are stopping humanity from achieving its potential.""

Matt Elder, on the other hand, is an experienced engineer who previously worked for Google and Quixey, and worked to oversee the architecture of the Reserve protocol's technical implementation.

Since its launch in 2019, the amount of contributors to the Reserve ecosystem has grown considerably, including community, engineers, and legal and compliance staff — all unified under the shared ambition to position Reserve as an open, massively scalable stablecoin platform that promotes economic prosperity.


What Makes Reserve Rights Unique?

Unlike other stablecoins that are typically backed by U.S. dollars (USD) held in reserve in a bank account controlled by the stablecoin issuer or a trusted custodian, Reserve stablecoins are backed by a basket of cryptocurrencies managed by smart contracts.

These baskets can consist of any ERC-20 assets. During the initial stages, RTokens mostly include other cryptocurrencies, such as liquid staking tokens (e.g. stETH) or yield-bearing DeFi position (e.g. cUSDC). Eventually, the Reserve community will transition to more diverse baskets, which might include fiat currencies, securities, commodities and complex asset types, like synthetics and derivatives. Read more about Reserve’s long-term goals here: https://reserve.org/protocol/our_long_term_goal/


How Many Reserve Rights (RSR) Coins Are There in Circulation?

Reserve Rights has a fixed supply of 100 billion tokens. Out of this, about 52% are currently in circulation as of September 2024.

The maximum token supply has already been pre-mined, but a large proportion is locked for various reasons, including 49.4% of the supply locked in a smart contract known as the ""Slow wallet.” Funds from this wallet are released according to a deterministic schedule, which you can read more about here: https://blog.reserve.org/reducing-rsr-emissions-6da7f35917ba

The Reserve Rights token initially launched with a circulating supply of 6.85 billion tokens, of which 3% were distributed to Huobi Prime IEO participants, 2.85% released as project tokens and 1% to private investors. All team, advisor, partner, and seed investor tokens have been unlocked via one of two options - one that has started in January 2022, and the other that started upon the launch of the full Reserve protocol on Ethereum mainnet. Read all about the Reserve Rights unlocking schedule here: https://reserve.org/protocol/reserve_rights_rsr/#reserve-rights-release-schedule.


How Is the Reserve Rights Network Secured?

Reserve Rights is currently an ERC-20 token based on the Ethereum blockchain. As a result, it is secured against attacks by a robust proof-of-work (POW) consensus mechanism backed by a network of thousands of Ethereum miners. 


Where Can You Buy Reserve Rights (RSR)?

Reserve Rights (RSR) is a popular token that currently maintains excellent liquidity. 

It is available to purchase and trade on several of the most well-established cryptocurrency exchange platforms, including Binance, Huobi Global and OKX, and can be traded against various popular cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Tether (USDT) and Ethereum (ETH), as well as the U.S. dollar (USD) on multiple platforms.

That means dApp users can interact with any asset, any application, on any chain, with one click. You can think of it as Stripe for Web3. Developers interact with a simple API atop a permissionless network that routes messages and ensures network security via proof-of-stake consensus.

Axelar is a blockchain that connects blockchains. To do this securely, Axelar network uses proof-of-stake consensus. Network validators produce new blocks, participate in multiparty signing and vote on external chain states. Tokenholders stake the AXL token, delegating tokens to a validator’s staking pool and receiving rewards, minus the validator’s commission.

The AXL token is used for governance and to pay network transaction fees to validators and tokenholders. However, users of the Axelar network do not need to hold the token. Conversions into AXL tokens and destination-chain tokens are handled on the back end, so that users need only pay gas once, in the source-chain token.

Axelar network rewards are “inflationary” — they increase the total supply of AXL — but there is potential for supply to become deflationary based on the transaction fee mechanic described above.

Amp is described as the new digital collateral token offering instant, verifiable assurances for any kind of value transfer. Using Amp, networks like Flexa can quickly and irreversibly secure transactions for a wide variety of asset-related use cases.

How does Amp work?

Amp claims to offer a straightforward but versatile interface for verifiable collateralization through a system of collateral partitions and collateral managers. Where collateral partitions can be designated to collateralize any account, application, or even transaction, and carry balances which are directly verifiable on the Ethereum blockchain, collateral managers are smart contracts that can lock, release, and redirect collateral in these partitions as needed in order to support value transfer activities. Amp supports a wide variety of use cases for collateralization, and also introduces the concept of predefined partition strategies, which can enable special capabilities such as collateral models through which tokens can be staked without ever leaving their original address.","","","decentralized finance (defi)","ethereum","66.0","39.88256315995944","0.0","42.199999999999996","1082","0","22.22","0"

Its core component is Polygon SDK, a modular, flexible framework that supports building multiple types of applications.

Using Polygon, one can create Optimistic Rollup chains, ZK Rollup chains, stand alone chains or any other kind of infra required by the developer. 

Polygon effectively transforms Ethereum into a full-fledged multi-chain system (aka Internet of Blockchains). This multi-chain system is akin to other ones such as Polkadot, Cosmos, Avalanche etc with the advantages of Ethereum’s security, vibrant ecosystem and openness.

Nothing will change for the existing ecosystem built on the Plasma-POS chain. With Polygon, new features are being built around the existing proven technology to expand the ability to cater to diverse needs from the developer ecosystem. Polygon will continue to develop the core technology so that it can scale to a larger ecosystem. 

The $MATIC token will continue to exist and will play an increasingly important role, securing the system and enabling governance.","","75.0","smart contract platform","ethereum","95.39999999999999","40.5676329749719","98.5971451201028","80.60000000000001","1156","0","66.33125079203597","0"

The wBTC token on the Ethereum blockchain is supported, allowing all wBTC token holders to enjoy both yield on staking BTC tokens and the security of the Ethereum network.

The need for BTC holders to earn yield while safely holding their BTC tokens has been long recognized. The market is anticipating Babylon's Bitcoin Staking Protocol as a prominent solution. While Babylon is designed for restaking on top of the BTC blockchain network, there is also interest in solutions for BTC-pegged tokens like wBTC, BTCB, or other wrapped BTC tokens, rather than just native BTC tokens.

Bedrock's uniBTC provides an innovative restaking solution for wBTC holders to earn BTC restaking rewards without redeeming wBTC. It maintains the high security standards of the Ethereum blockchain, with the entire staking/unstaking process protected by multiple rounds of audited smart contracts.

With Bedrock's extensive experience in developing various liquid staking and liquid restaking products, uniBTC offers a viable option for users of wrapped BTC tokens to earn multiple rewards by simply minting their wrapped BTC tokens into uniBTC.","","","bnb chain ecosystem","ethereum","74.3","50.628615269585005","48.870208587865434","58.5","1256","0","43.40579800575291","0"

1inch Network is a decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator to help users discover the best trade prices for tokens. Instead of swapping tokens from a single liquidity pool of a DEX, 1inch will aggregate across different pools and suggest the most efficient way to trade tokens.

Why use 1inch?
If you are a trader trading large amount of tokens, you may not be aware of all the availability liquidity across different DEXes in order to get the best price quote. Price quote offered by DEX fluctuates according to the liquidity pool at any given time. Also, when you are trading large size, every percentage of savings can be magnified with an optimal trading path. 1inch aims to solve all that in a single user friendly interface.

What is Pathfinder?
Pathfinder is the discovery and routing algorithm developed by the 1inch team. It is the algorithm the powers the backend to finding the most efficient route to swap a token. For example, if a user wants to sell ETH for WBTC, Pathfinder will explore all DEXes such as Uniswap, Curve, Balancer, DODO, Sushiswap, and more. The result is a recommended route that optimizes fees and liquidity in order to give users the best rate. Users no longer need to check each individual services in order to find the best price.

Who are the creators of 1inch?
1inch was founded by Sergej Kunz and Anton Bukov. The idea for 1inch was developed at a hackathon in just over 60 hours at New York City. Fast forward today, it is one of the fastest growing DeFi product.""","","","decentralized exchange (dex)","ethereum","74.4","40.73584335645211","0.0","55.800000000000004","1538","0","25.6323","0"

In addition, Livepeer is meant to provide an economically efficient alternative to centralized broadcasting solutions for any existing broadcaster. In this document we describe the Livepeer Protocol - a delegated stake based protocol for incentivizing participants in a live video broadcast network in a game-theoretically secure way. We present solutions for the scalable verification of decentralized work, as well as the prevention of useless work in an attempt to game the token allocations in an inflationary system.

The Livepeer Token (LPT) is the protocol token of the Livepeer network. But it is not the medium of exchange token. Broadcasters use Ethereum's Ether (ETH) to broadcast video on the network. Nodes who contribute processing and bandwidth earn ETH in the form of fees from broadcasters. LPT is a staking token that participants who want to perform work on the network stake in order to coordinate how work gets distributed on the network, and to provide security that the work will get done honestly and correctly. LPT has the following purposes:

It serves as a bonding mechanism in a delegated proof of stake system, in which stake is delegated towards transcoders (or validators) who participate in the protocol to transcode video and validate work. The token, and potential slashing that occurs due to protocol violation, is necessary in order to secure the network against a number of attacks. More below.
It routes work through the network in proportion to the amount of staked and delegated token, essentially serving as a coordination mechanism.

It is a unit of account that is specific to the Livepeer ecosystem, which forms the basis of a SectorCoin concept, applicable to additional functionality to be introduced in the future. Services such as DVR, closed captioning, ad insertion/monetization, and analytics can all plug into the Livepeer ecosystem and potentially make use of the security provided by staking LPT.

An initial allocation of Livepeer Token will be distributed so that stakeholders can fulfill various roles in, and use the network, and then additional token will be issued according to algorithmically programmed issuance over time.

Following the conventions of Ethereum and many popular ERC20 tokens, LPT will be divisible by 10 ^ 18, with larger denominations such as the LPT itself intended to be used for user level transactions such as staking, and smaller denominations intended to be used for protocol accounting.","2018-10-01","80.0","artificial intelligence (ai)","ethereum","85.9","41.42783597586056","87.06027777888032","46.2","2747","2461","65.44159722260812","0"

Golem Network is an open-source, decentralized computing platform that is building an ecosystem to provide computing power to the AI industry. A peer-to-peer marketplace for distributed computing resources. Users engage directly on the Golem platform, exchanging GLM tokens for the utilization of their idle computing resources.

Golem allows to break down tasks into smaller subtasks and distribute them across multiple providers, enabling parallel processing. This approach boosts efficiency and speeds up the completion of complex computations.

What is GLM?

GLM or Golem Network Token is needed to pay for computations on the network and is the currency that drives the marketplace. As a Requestor, you set a bid for an amount of GLM you are willing to pay to have your task completed. As a Provider, you earn GLM by computing tasks for Requestors.

How can I get involved?

If you want to stay up to date with the latest developments and updates, join the Golem Network Discord community here: https://chat.golem.network/

On Discord you can also find support to become a Provider or a Requestor in the Golem platform.","","","artificial intelligence (ai)","ethereum","57.9","44.554763571511415","73.3579802649421","36.8","1162","0","46.54799309272973","0"

Just as Monero is solely focused on privacy, Ravencoin specializes in asset transfer – nothing more, nothing less. Although you can exchange assets over other blockchains, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, that’s not their intended purpose. And the lack of specialization leads to problems that are specific to transferring assets. Ravencoin enables you to create and trade any real-world (e.g., gold bars, land deeds) or digital (e.g., gaming items, software licenses) assets on a network with only that in mind.

Ravencoin doesn’t have an established team. It’s an open-source project led by the core developers: RavoncoinDev, Tron, and Chatturga (discord usernames). Bruce Fenton, Board Member of The Bitcoin Foundation, advises the team. The core developers launched Ravencoin on January 3rd, 2018 and Fenton kicked off the launch with a Tweet announcing the start of mining. The project gained some notoriety when Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne announced that his company had made a multi-million dollar investment into the team. Since then, the team has been building out the core functionality of asset support and rewards capabilities.

The release of the Ravencoin mainnet and increase in activity on the platform should help the price. Any news of notable companies or financial institutions utilizing the platform should also have a positive effect. Ravencoin offers just one thing: tokenized asset transfer. And that singular focus isn’t a bad thing. When projects attempt to solve a bunch of problems at once, they often create a bunch of half-baked solutions. Ravencoin is avoiding that. As a young project with seemingly endless competition, it’s difficult to predict how successful Ravencoin will be. An active community and backing from one of the most respected names in online retail are positive indicators, though. There’s a clear trend toward the tokenization of all types of assets. However, we have yet to see whether or not Ravencoin will be leading that change.","2018-01-03","57.14","smart contract platform","unknown","92.60000000000001","43.3307822041539","98.82749391359677","51.2","2083","2732","71.10652286975886","0"

Zilliqa is mainly based on the concept of Sharding and primarily aims at improving the scalability of the cryptocurrency networks as in case of Bitcoin or Ethereum. The white paper mentions that the transactions speed would be approximately a thousand times more than that of Ethereum network. Ziliqa is fast, secured and decentralized. Zilliqa’s high throughput means that you can focus on developing your ideas without worrying about network congestion, high transaction fees or security which are the key issues with legacy blockchain platforms. Zilliqa network uses a concept called Sharding where the transactions are grouped into smaller groups and divided among the miners for the parallel transactional verification. Developing smaller groups for transactional verification means the Consensus can be reached faster and hence a higher number of transactions can be processed in a given time frame. The capacity of the network linearly increases in other cryptocurrencies as the number of people joins the network, but in this case, the capacity is increased at a higher variable rate than the number of members joining the network. By incorporating the Sharding Technology, it can completely revolutionize the smart contract functionality too. Ziliqa has few pros as it has a great new technology. Zilliqa is the first platform to use sharding technology. This puts it ahead of the rest of the market. It’s a completely new kind of blockchain designed to solve the problem of scalability. Third-generation platforms like Zilliqa could be the big winners in the future of cryptocurrency. Ziliqa has a strong community. The platform has a lot of fans. The Zilliqa ICO only happened because there was so much demand for it. The Zilliqa ICO also shows that the crypto community is ready to see blockchain technology move to the next phase of its development.","2019-01-31","100.0","smart contract platform","binance-smart-chain","93.60000000000001","44.16121454636263","98.4580150026953","60.9","1915","2339","72.99845525094337","0"

Qtum uses proof-of-stake consensus, meaning node operators are rewarded for validating transactions. It is a DGP governed blockchain where community participants can vote to change certain network parameters. Qtum is built on a bitcoin core fork, but the foundation has created its own hybrid blockchain with the help of several key tools. The coin uses bitcoin’s chain because of its simple and stable nature, allowing the foundation to build upon it more easily.

As the QTUM project is a hybrid of Bitcoin and Ethereum, its team comprises of members from both Bitcoin and Ethereum community. They also have team members who formerly worked with Tencent, Alibaba, Nasdaq etc. Apart from that, they are backed by some notable VCs and prominent people from the Blockchain community such as Patrick Dai (Project Co-Founder), Neil Mahi (Chief Blockchain Architect/Co-Founder) and Jordan Earls (Lead Developer/Co-Founder).

Qtum provides a Turing-complete blockchain stack and is able to execute smart contracts and decentralised applications like the Ethereum blockchain.

Qtum builds on Bitcoin's UTXO transaction model and uses the Proof-of-Stake algorithm. It is backed by some highly prominent members of the blockchain community such as Anthony Di Iorio, Xu Star, Bo Shen, David Lee, Jehan Chu and Roger Ver.








Qtum sold over 10 million dollars’ worth of its tokens after only 90 minutes, eventually raising a total value of $15.7 million before stopping the campaign early after only 5 days. They raised a total amount of 11,156.766 bitcoins (BTC) and 77,081.031 ether (ETH) in exchange for the 51 million Qtum tokens being distributed to the public.

Convex allows Curve liquidity providers to earn trading fees and claim boosted CRV without locking CRV themselves. Liquidity providers can receive boosted CRV and liquidity mining rewards with minimal effort.
If you would like to stake CRV, Convex lets users receive trading fees as well as a share of boosted CRV received by liquidity providers. This allows for a better balance between liquidity providers and CRV stakers as well as better capital efficiency.

Curve liquidity providers can deposit their LP tokens into Convex to maximize their CRV earnings with a more efficient boost.

Curve DAO token stakers will be able to earn additional boosted CRV and CVX tokens through the protocol.

The platform’s two main components are the Analytics Platform and Intel Exchange. The Analytics Platform covers analytics on various entities, exchanges, funds, whales and tokens. The Intel Exchange allows anyone to buy and sell address labels and other intelligence, either through bounties, auctions or the DATA Program.

Unlike many other platforms that focus on specific blockchains or limited data sources, Arkham aims to provide total coverage of the blockchain by collecting and aggregating data from various chains. This is done leveraging its proprietary AI system, ULTRA. It allows users to analyze and gain insights from a comprehensive view of the crypto ecosystem.

 The Arkham Intel Exchange is a decentralized marketplace where users can buy and sell crypto intelligence using the native currency, ARKM. This unique feature enables individuals and organizations to monetize their intelligence by offering bounties and conducting auctions. The exchange connects buyers and sellers, fostering a vibrant community of on-chain sleuths and ensuring the availability of valuable intelligence for market participants.

Arkham Intelligence was founded by Miguel Morel in 2020. Miguel is a veteran entrepreneur in cryptocurrency markets. Miguel’s experience navigating new crypto markets makes him familiar with the intelligence needs of decision makers in government, venture capital, and trading. He is also an investor in a number of technology startups.

Arkham Intelligence has also attracted some of the most prominent investors in the crypto space and beyond. Among them are an undisclosed OpenAI Co-Founder, Palantir Co-Founder Joe Lonsdale (8VC), Tim Draper (Draper Associates), Wintermute, GSR, and Geoff Lewis (Bedrock). The company raised over $10 million in two rounds of equity financing, and was valued at $150 million in its last round.","","100.0","artificial intelligence (ai)","ethereum","80.0","40.363369217529396","0.0","66.8","1998","0","28.390174999999996","0"

Basic Attention Token held an initial coin offering on May 31, 2017 for its eponymous ERC-20 utility token, raising approximately $35M USD at the time in less than 30 seconds. The Basic Attention Token aims to fix digital advertising, which is broken, fraudulent and opaque. 

Basic Attention Token work by having advertisers pay BAT to website publishers for the attention of users. The BAT token is designed to correctly value and price user attention within the platform. The Basic Attention Token comprises various components, including attention measurement systems, analytics dashboards and machine learning algorithms. Integration of BAT into a given host application involves implementing BAT Ads, a system that matches and displays ads to users based on locally stored data. Ad targeting is performed wholly on-device, removing the need for third-party tracking. BAT is focused on the Brave browser. Brave is an open-source, privacy-centered browser designed to block trackers and malware. It utilizes blockchain technology to anonymously and securely track user attention, which translates into rewards for publishers.

A user's attention, meaning his or her focused mental engagement on digital content like advertisements, is logged through Brave. The makers of BAT indicate that the user's private data and tracking information is stored only on the user's device, ensuring that it is anonymous and private.

Created back in 2016, the Basic Attention Token has one of the biggest names behind it, that of Brendan Eich, the creator of JavaScript and the legendary co-founder of Mozilla. Other noteworthy team members include Brian Bondy, lead developer and co-founder of Brave and Scott Locklin, senior engineer, and co-founder of Kerf Software.""

Basic Attention Token is created by the team that built the Brave browser, an open-source, privacy-focused browser that blocks ads and trackers. The browser measures user attention and rewards publishers for users attention.

With this and its approach towards CPU mining and ASICs, Verus Coin may also be the most naturally decentralizing and attack resistant blockchain to exist.
Over and above its leading privacy, interchain contracts, and security features, Verus Coin's next steps include automated provisioning of public blockchains as a service, using the same technology that Verus developers created and used to solve the """"nothing at stake"""" problem. At that point, the first applications that will allow provisioning of chains on their behalf will be polls and elections.

Verus introduces a new consensus algorithm called Proof of Power, a 50% PoW / 50% PoS algorithm, which solves theoretical weaknesses in other PoS systems, and is provably immune to 51% hash attacks, making Verus one of, if not the most, double-spend resistant public blockchain(s) running. With its groundbreaking consensus protocol, Verus also uses a unique hash algorithm, VerusHash, a quantum secure hash algorithm that is near-equally mineable on both CPUs and GPUs.  The Verus Coin’s project vision includes automatically provisioned public blockchains as a service.

GoMining is a digital mining platform that offers multiple ways to earn Bitcoin and leverage exposure to it via a user-friendly ecosystem powered by the GOMINING utility token. This ecosystem’s key offerings include digital miner collectibles linked to real Bitcoin mining power and a competitive GameFi mining experience in the Miner Wars game.
What are Digital Miners?
Digital Miners are GoMining’s flagship product, offering an easy and efficient way to mine Bitcoin. Backed by real-world datacenter hashrate and cutting-edge mining hardware, these digital assets work similarly to a call option in finance: users pay the cost to mine Bitcoin (the ‘strike price’) and keep any profits if Bitcoin’s value exceeds this cost. Thanks to access to advanced equipment and wholesale electricity rates—further reducible by up to 20% with the GOMINING token—production costs rival those of large-scale industrial miners. This accessibility and efficiency make GoMining’s Digital Miners a reliable, scalable, and globally available method to leverage long-term Bitcoin potential.
What is Miner Wars?
Miner Wars is a GameFi, blockchain-based game launched by GoMining in September 2024, offering players an engaging and competitive way to compete for Bitcoin (BTC) and GOMINING payouts. GoMinig mimics how blocks are being solved on the actual blockchain, where ‘Clans’ (groups of players pooling their digital miners’ power) compete to solve blocks. Adding to the strategic depth, players can use Boosts to enhance their scores during each round.
##**What is the GOMINING token?**
GOMINING is a utility token that powers the GoMining ecosystem. Directly tied to real mining operations, it also offers a way to leverage Bitcoin. GOMINNG provides up to 20% off digital miner maintenance fees for GoMining users, which boosts token demand as our community grows (currently owning over 1% of global BTC hashrate). With a deflationary model that permanently burns part of maintenance fees paid in GOMINING each week, and over 30% of the supply locked in governance for an average of two years, GOMINING’s scarcity and value are positioned to steadily increase. This makes GOMINING a Bitcoin derivative designed to amplify Bitcoin’s growth within its dynamic ecosystem.
GoMining’s suite of innovative Bitcoin leverage products offers a unique way for both experienced crypto users and newcomers to benefit from Bitcoin’s growth, helping to drive its mainstream adoption.","","","gaming (gamefi)","ethereum","91.60000000000001","50.993358714190514","54.9956479710109","90.4","2483","0","53.54292678985381","0"

The protocol is maintained by various independent developers and is governed by YFI holders.

It started out as a passion project by Andre Cronje to automate the process of switching capital between lending platforms in search of the best yield offered, as the lending yield is a floating rate rather than fixed rate. Funds are shifted between dYdX, AAVE, and Compound automatically as interest rates change between these protocols. 

The service offered includes major USD tokens such as DAI, USDT, USDC, and TUSD. For example, if a user deposits DAI into yearn.finance, the user will receive yDAI token in return, which is a yield-bearing DAI token. 

Later on, it collaborated with Curve Finance to release a yield-bearing USD tokens pool that includes four y-tokens: yDAI, yUSDT, yUSDC and yTUSD, it is named as yUSD. 

Yearn Finance debuted the vault feature after its token launch, igniting a frenzy on automated yield farming and is considered the initiator of the category of yield farming aggregator. Basically, the vault will help users to claim yield farming rewards and sell it for the underlying assets. 

Vaults benefit users by socializing gas costs, automating the yield generation and rebalancing process, and automatically shifting capital as opportunities arise. End users also do not need to have proficient knowledge of the underlying protocols involved or DeFi, thus the Vaults represent a passive-investing strategy. It is akin to a crypto hedge fund where the aim is to increase the amount of assets that users deposited.

In the world of traditional finance, this process is typically facilitated by trusted and permissioned third-parties such as banks, who connect people with a surplus of money to those who need access to it in the short term. In the world of decentralised finance (DeFi), trusted and permissioned third-parties are no longer needed; banks have been replaced by trustless and permissionless lending protocols running on the blockchain (1).
Among the first-generation of DeFi lending protocols are Compound (2) and Aave (3). These protocols provide users with access to lending and borrowing capabilities for a handful of the most liquid ERC20 tokens. However, these protocols were not designed to handle the risks associated with lending and borrowing illiquid or volatile assets and have therefore relied on a permissioned listing system to protect their users from the risks associated with such assets.
Consequently, there remains significant unmet demand for lending and borrowing the long tail of crypto assets. On the lending side, users want to deposit tokens to earn yield and take leveraged long positions. On the borrowing side, users want to reduce their exposure to volatility and take leveraged short positions. Here, we present Euler: a permissionless lending protocol custom-built with an array of new features to help users lend and borrow more types of tokens than ever before.","","100.0","lending/borrowing protocols","ethereum","64.4","58.66223513113914","0.0","60.099999999999994","1490","0","26.70655","0"

Network users are rewarded with the latter when they hold the former, which is also the case with NEO &amp; GAS. The VeChain Token can be used to deploy applications on the platform where as VeThor can be used to pay for applications and other transactions over the network. VeChain claims that this economic model is better suited for enterprises than the one in other blockchains, such as Ethereum and Bitcoin, where higher usage drives the cost of the utility token and subsequently the cost of deploying and operations in the protocol.

In an official blog post earlier this year, the foundation announced it’s “grand aspirations to make financial services sector one of the main focuses on our development plan”. They also announced their partnership with a property mortgage loan provider Fanghuwang.com, a subsidiary of Beijing Baisheng Technology Co., Ltd. They also reported partnerships with BMW, Groupe Renault, and DNV GL.
Until now, VeChain has existed in the form of an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain. In an announcement detailing the roadmap moving forward, the foundation stated that they would engage in negotiations with exchanges to perform the token swap to become an independent network. The roadmap also detailed plans to launch a mobile wallet and ledger integration.","","66.67","layer 1 (l1)","vechain","90.10000000000001","42.80593935374004","98.243070053756","66.60000000000001","1397","0","62.7149745188146","0"

OriginTrail is an ecosystem building a trusted knowledge infrastructure for artificial intelligence (AI). It addresses the challenge of misinformation in the AI era by ensuring the origin of information and enabling discoverability of the world's most important knowledge and real-world assets (RWAs).
OriginTrail is creating a verifiable Internet for decentralized AI by empowering world-class brands and builders. It utilizes its unique Decentralized Knowledge Graph and  NeuroWeb blockchain to deliver AI-powered search and solutions for enterprises and individuals worldwide.
OriginTrail has gained support and partnerships with world-class organizations such as British Standards Institution, SCAN, Polkadot, Parity, Walmart, World Federation of Hemophilia, Oracle, the EU Commission's Next Generation Internet, and Microsoft Entrepreneurship for Positive Impact. These partnerships contribute to advancing OriginTrail's trusted knowledge foundation and its applicability in trillion-dollar industries, while providing a verifiable Internet of knowledge important in particular to drive the economies of RWAs.
The best way to see the technology in action is by checking ChatDKG,  an experimental, question-answering bot on X (Twitter) based on trusted Knowledge Assets in OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG). The ChatDKG provides answers based on OriginTrail trusted AI.
The Metcalfe phase of OriginTrail’s roadmap pursues an ambitious goal of creating the world’s largest verifiable Internet for AI, consisting of 100 billion Knowledge Assets, bringing a 100,000x scalability increase. As the name of the phase suggests, it seeks to produce network effects across the OriginTrail DKG and use novel techniques to pursue autonomous DKG growth based on the Genesis knowledge foundation being created by organizations and individuals alike. The Genesis part of the Metcalfe’s phase also introduces knowledge mining and knowledge signaling capabilities to drive constant growth of the verifiable Internet.
Following the Genesis stage and the transition to an AI-native V8, further capabilities will become available in the Convergence stage. By leveraging the advancements in AI and the DKG, we will unlock autonomous knowledge mining which in turn leads to an autonomous DKG. At that stage, new knowledge gets added to the DKG with very limited human involvement. Services such as AI agents will be performing knowledge inferencing directly on the DKG to find any “blind spots” in the knowledge they can fill as well as search for new knowledge and bring it to the DKG in accordance with knowledge signaling.

Who are the founders of OriginTrail?
The founders of OriginTrail, Žiga Drev, Tomaž Levak, and Branimir Rakić, established OriginTrail with a vision to build and implement a Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG)—an infrastructure designed to bring trusted knowledge sharing to enterprises and individuals across the globe. Their mission was to address the growing need for verifiable, transparent, and decentralized data in an increasingly complex digital world. This vision has led to adoption by major institutions, including the British Standards Institution (BSI), the Supplier Compliance Audit Network (SCAN), Swiss Federal Railways (SBB), World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH), and numerous EU and UK government-backed projects.
Guided by principles of neutrality, inclusiveness, and usability, the founders spearheaded partnerships with leading technology companies and initiated a grant program to minimize development risks and foster community growth within the OriginTrail ecosystem.
As part of their ongoing mission to tackle AI-era challenges—such as misinformation, deepfakes, and data manipulation—Trace Labs, the core developers behind OriginTrail, became a founding shareholder in Umanitek. Umanitek builds on the symbolic-AI foundation of the DKG to ensure information trust, defend data ownership, and uphold censorship-resistant digital infrastructure","2018-01-24","100.0","artificial intelligence (ai)","ethereum","81.0","46.22504885410727","95.35009262168845","51.0","4030","2711","69.77088241759095","0"

The only difference is Sia uses blockchain to facilitate transactions Nodes provide storage to clients using the Sia blockchain as contracts. Before storing the data, the data is encrypted into many pieces and uploaded to different hosts. 

Siacoin is created by David Vorick and Luke Champine of Nebulous Inc. As the traditional storage platforms are higher in cost, more expensive and data is not well protected. Siacoin promises to offer secured storage transactions with smart contracts which is more affordable and reliable. Moreover, it is completely open source which means many individuals have contributed to Siacoin’s software hence there will be an active community building innovative applications on top if the Sia API. 

In 2018, Siacoin aims to introduce file sharing and be the go-to cloud storage platform for companies. Their goal is divided into 3 time frames which are short-term, medium-term and long-term development. Short-term development focuses on file sharing between Sia users. This allows Sia users to share files in the platform without having to take it off the cloud while increasing network utilization. Medium-term development’s goal is to enhance partnerships. This means reaching out to large companies like Netflix and Dropbox to hopefully be able to be their storage and distribution framework. Lastly, long-term development aims to expand its horizon to share files with non-Sia users and support mobile wallets.

Kinesis gold (KAU) is a gold-backed cryptocurrency, launched by Kinesis - a global trading and digital asset utility platform. Each Kinesis gold (KAU) token is backed by 1 gram of investment-grade gold bullion, securely stored in Kinesis’ fully insured, audited vaults.
The mission behind KAU is to reintroduce physical gold backing to money and provide the global community with a stable store of value. Kinesis gold (KAU) has the everyday utility of a fiat currency; the borderless efficiency of a cryptocurrency, and none of the inherent volatility. 
KAU enables physical gold bullion to be instantly purchased, traded, spent and sent anywhere in the world, bringing real-world access, value, and utility to physical precious metals. A true stablecoin, KAU allows crypto traders to easily exit volatile markets and enter into the enduring value of physical gold, while earning a monthly yield.

What makes KAU unique?
In an economic first, KAU holders earned the first debt-free yield on precious metals. All KAU holders receive a passive yield - paid monthly in KAU - simply for holding their metals on the Kinesis platform. The yield is calculated from a 15% share of Kinesis’ global transaction fee revenue which is shared with users who store their gold on the platform. At the time of writing, Kinesis has paid out over $3,000,000 to KAU holders. 

Unlike other gold tokens, KAU can be instantly spent with the Kinesis Virtual Card, worldwide. Accessible via mobile device, the virtual card lets people everywhere instantly convert their KAU holdings into local currency at the point of sale, anywhere Mastercard is accepted. Through digitalising physical gold in the form of KAU, Kinesis has successfully reintroduced gold as a currency.

Can I redeem my gold? 
Every single gram of gold underpinning KAU is available for redemption, at the click of a button. While other gold-backed cryptos offer redemption, they often set very high minimum withdrawal limits.

In the MGG ecosystem, all tokens are created solely through node operation rewards. There is no team allocation or external reserve supply, and the distribution mechanism is designed to ensure fair and transparent reward issuance based on smart contract logic.
The platform supports various game developers and publishers who can integrate blockchain functionality into their games using the MimboNode API and SDK. This enables in-game assets and rewards to be securely issued, stored, and traded via blockchain.
MGG’s tokenomics promote sustainability and community participation through utility in staking, governance, and access to exclusive game content. The team is preparing for listings on decentralized exchanges (DEX), and a smart contract audit is underway to ensure platform security.
As part of its roadmap, MGG plans to expand into global markets and form strategic partnerships with GameFi platforms, enhancing user engagement and token utility within the gaming space.","","","bnb chain ecosystem","binance-smart-chain","74.8","53.97758427559828","0.0","87.5","1284","0","33.5519","0"

cGLD is a native cryptographic digital asset created at the mainnet release of the Celo Platform. cGLD has no relationship to physical gold.

cGLD is a utility and governance asset required to participate on the Celo Platform. Some uses include:

Running a validator to secure and operate aspects of the Celo Platform
Voting for validators working to secure and operate the Celo Platform
Participating in governance decisions to influence the future of the Celo Platform
Supporting applications on the platform
cGLD forms part of the overcollateralized reserve that supports the Celo stable value assets (initially Celo Dollar or cUSD).

The Celo Protocol automatically adds cGLD to the reserve whenever the Celo stable value asset supply increases.","","100.0","smart contract platform","celo","90.5","39.68523630326312","97.51551929758692","57.4","1063","0","60.149456754155416","0"

Launched on mainnet in March 2021, Casper provides infrastructure for tokenized assets, featuring upgradable smart contracts, protocol-level access control, and native support for multiple virtual machines (VMs).

The network runs on Zug Consensus, a deterministic protocol offering instant finality that is crucial for financial transactions, regulated assets, and enterprise workflows. Casper is also among the first Layer-1 networks to support multiple VMs running in parallel, allowing applications with different technical needs to operate natively on the same chain without relying on rollups or Layer-2 solutions.

Offering a familiar and modern development environment, Casper prioritizes developer accessibility. Supporting Rust, WebAssembly (WASM), and SDKs in mainstream languages like JavaScript, Python, and Go, Casper enables millions of developers, not just Web3 specialists, to build production-grade blockchain applications without learning obscure or domain-specific tools.","","66.67","smart contract platform","casper-network","78.8","45.144011354859664","0.0","87.3","1087","0","33.49545","0"

Data is about remembering our lived and shared experiences. Distributing the storage and processing of that data can change how we coordinate and interact. With digital integration under user control, Holochain liberates our online lives from corporate control over our choices and information.

Holochain is an energy efficient post-blockchain ledger system and decentralized application platform that uses peer-to-peer networking for processing agent centric agreement and consensus systems between users.

Holochain enables any device to have its own chain based ledger system. By using a holographic model for data storage and transfer developers can now create decentralized applications that can scale in multiple dimensions across a network ensuring they are truly distributed. This enables every device on a network to function independently, and only requires the synchronization of data when necessary, or agreed upon by users. This means every user is in control of their own data, and never has to risk their data being sold or exposed to 3rd parties like what just happened with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.

Holochain provides a framework for developers to build decentralized applications and aims to change the paradigm of data-centric blockchains to an agent-centric system. In Holochain’s fledgling system, no true global consensus is maintained. Instead, each agent in the public blockchain maintains a private fork, essentially, that is managed and stored in a limited way on the public blockchain with a distributed hash table. This means there are no scalability limits and dapps hosted on Holochain can do much more with less of nearly everything than traditional blockchains.

This system however has some inherent weaknesses. Because the entire blockchain must be verified by each member of the network, scalability problems quickly develop. The larger the amount of data being handled, the more restrictive the limit of transactions per second that can occur on the blockchain at any one time.Holochain itself is open source and written in Go. Go was selected for its ease of use and similarity to C. Dapps written specifically for Holochain can be developed with JavaScript or Lisp, with support for front-end systems using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.

The developers added that Holochain is relatively flexible when it comes to handling new languages, so there is potential for growth on that front. Holochain bills itself as an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional blockchains. Because there is no need for each individual agent to store and validate the global blockchain, Holochain only consumes a fraction of the bandwidth of traditional chains. Holochain also does not have a mining component, so there’s no electricity or processing power spent on proof-of-work calculations.

Arthur Brock and Eric Harris-Braun are the co-founders of Holochain and creators of Holochain. They have been designing alternatives currencies since the 80’s and have been working on Holu since before the Bitcoin whitepaper was written. To protect the incentives of users, founders and developers, Holochain is owned by a non-profit foundation. he company’s advisory team also includes Ryan Bubinski, the co-founder of CodeAcademy. In June, Holochain announced a new strategic partnership with Promether, an Adaptive Symbiotic Platform (ASP) that implements all the networking, security and anonymization code applications need to protect their data.","","85.71","smart contract platform","ethereum","89.1","40.39815697015771","98.44917015987951","54.900000000000006","3600","0","59.87965955595783","0"

Kinesis silver (KAG) is a silver-backed cryptocurrency, launched by Kinesis - a global trading and digital asset utility platform. Each Kinesis silver (KAG) token is backed by 1 ounce of investment-grade silver bullion, securely stored in Kinesis’ fully insured, audited vaults.
The mission behind KAG is to reintroduce physical silver backing to money and provide the global community with a stable store of value. Kinesis silver (KAG) has the everyday utility of a fiat currency; the borderless efficiency of a cryptocurrency, and none of the inherent volatility.
KAG enables physical silver bullion to be instantly purchased, traded, spent and sent anywhere in the world, bringing real-world access, value, and utility to physical precious metals. A true stablecoin, KAG allows crypto traders to easily exit volatile markets and enter into the enduring value of physical silver, while earning a monthly yield.
What makes KAG unique?
In an economic first, KAG holders earned the first debt-free yield on precious metals. All KAG holders receive a passive yield - paid monthly in KAG - simply for holding their metals on the Kinesis platform. The yield is calculated from a 15% share of Kinesis’ global transaction fee revenue which is shared with users who store their silver on the platform.
Unlike other silver tokens, KAG can be instantly spent with the Kinesis Virtual Card, worldwide. Accessible via mobile device, the virtual card lets people everywhere instantly convert their KAG holdings into local currency at the point of sale, anywhere Mastercard is accepted. Through digitalising physical gold in the form of KAG, Kinesis has successfully reintroduced silver as a currency.
Can I redeem my silver?
Every single ounce of silver underpinning KAG is available for redemption, at the click of a button. While other silver-backed cryptos offer redemption, they often set very high minimum withdrawal limits, making redemption unfeasible for everyday investors.","","","stablecoins","unknown","55.50000000000001","52.18243616327046","38.74329817067459","48.6","2008","0","37.4008543597361","0"

The token incentivizes and rewards a variety of participants including developers, validators/stakers, investors, and community members who develop, secure and govern the network. In order to use the network, users pay a small transaction fee denominated in the native Harmony token.

Harmony’s scalable, high-throughput protocol is powered by a native token which is used for various forms of payment and participation in the protocol (staking, transaction fees, voting & governance).

Harmony uses blockchain to align incentives of different stakeholders, developers and businesses while allowing them to build open marketplaces of fungible and non-fungible tokens and assets. Furthermore, the upcoming application of zero-knowledge proofs will allow Harmony to become a data sharing platform that can overcome the conflicting problem plaguing many information and data markets: that individual market participants’ have mutual distrust to share data but strong desire to acquire data themselves.

The Harmony token will function in the following aspects of the protocol:

The token is used for staking, which is necessary to participate in the POS consensus & earn block rewards and transaction fees.
The token is used to pay for transaction fees, gas and storage fees.
The token is used in voting for on-chain governance of the protocol.","","50.0","smart contract platform","unknown","92.5","41.66214853199548","98.57952850654067","69.69999999999999","1460","0","63.608334977289225","0"

USR achieves its peg by hedging its collateral pool and maintaining a tokenized insurance fund called RLP. Users can stake USR to obtain the yield-bearing version called stUSR. USR is minted by depositing liquid assets, such as USDC or USDT, on 1:1 value basis. When USR is redeemed, a user receives a 1:1 equivalent to the notional amount.

RLP:
ETH portfolio backs USR with a more than 100% ratio. Excess part of collateral acts as a backing for RLP - Resolv Liquidity Pool. Key features of RLP:
RLP is designed to protect USR from market and counterparty risks. In exchange, RLP users receive higher portion of profits of the collateral pool.
RLP has a price, representing value of ETH backing a single unit of RLP token;
RLP price can vary. Collateral required for minting or redemption is based on the latest price;","","","lp tokens","ethereum","51.800000000000004","50.38599770135459","0.0","43.8","932","0","22.61355","0"

MAG7.ssi carefully selected top 7 projects by market cap, with strong social consensus and ample liquidity. This product offers enhanced systematic beta returns from the crypto industry while providing high risk resistance.
The initial 10% equal weighting allocation provides sufficient weight to second-tier leaders outside of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Assuming the emergence of more $100 billion market cap tokens over the next 4 years, this structure helps investors secure foundational returns from the crypto industry while also offering the opportunity to capture excess returns from the rise of new industry leaders.
Monthly rebalance with a buffer setting ensures timely inclusion of emerging leaders while minimizing the transaction friction caused by frequent rebalancing. ","","","decentralized finance (defi)","base","82.8","47.25473346774508","0.0","96.1","1224","0","35.7001","0"

DigiByte is more than a faster digital currency. It is an innovative blockchain that can be used for digital assets, smart contracts, decentralized applications and secure authentication.


What makes DigiByte stronger than others?
DigiByte is a rapidly growing open-source blockchain created in late 2013 and released in early 2014. After 6 years of forward thinking development, DigiByte has become one of the safest, fastest, longest and most decentralized UTXO blockchain in existence.


Truly Decentralized.
DigiByte has never been funded through an ICO or significant amount of premined coins. There is no CEO or a company controlling the DigiByte blockchain. It is a volunteer based and global community driven project.


More secure.
DigiByte uses 5 cryptographic algorithms and real time difficulty adjustment to prevent malicious mining centralization and hash power fluctuation. One of which is Odocrypt that changes itself every 10 days for ASIC resistance.


Much faster.
DigiByte blocks occur every 15 seconds which is 40x faster than Bitcoin and 10x faster than Litecoin. Early SegWit implementation and blockchain rigidity enable up to 1066 on-chain transactions per second with negligible fees.


Forward thinking.
Over the past 6 years, DigiByte has repeatedly set itself apart with multiple blockchain firsts, such asDigiShield guard, MultiAlgo mining, SegWit implementation, Odocrypt algorithm, Dandelion++ privacy protocol, DigiAssets and Digi-ID.

 
 

This is how the DigiByte blockchain works.
The three layers are the most innovative parts of the DigiByte blockchain providing the network infrastructure, security and communications to function with cutting edge speed.
 

Applications / DigiAssets.
The top layer is like an app store with clear real-world uses. All types of digital assets can be created with the DigiAssets protocol on top of the DigiByte blockchain. Decentralized applications (dApps) can be built on top of the DigiByte blockchain. Also smart contracts that leverage the rigidity and security of the DigiByte blockchain can be encoded easily.


Digital asset / Public ledger.
The middle layer provides security and administration. A Digital Byte of data, a representation of larger data or a unit that holds value, and cannot be counterfeited, duplicated or hacked. An immutable public ledger where all transactions of DigiBytes are recorded. DigiByte uses five proof of work algorithms for security. New DigiBytes come from mining only.


Core protocol / Global network.
The bottom layer provides communication and operating procedures. A very low-level way nodes on the DigiByte global network communicate. Thousands of people are running DigiByte software all across the planet. Any server, computer, tablet or mobile phone connected to the DigiByte network becomes a node that helps relay transactions.

 
Open source / Permissionless.
Just like the DigiByte.io website, the DigiByte blockchain is completely open source and free to use released under the MIT license, which gives you the power to run and modify the software. Transparency allows for independent verification of binaries and their corresponding source code.

 

 

A digital currency you would absolutely love.
DigiByte (DGB) is a highly scalable peer-to-peer digital currency that enables industry-leading transaction speeds with negligible fees. DigiByte is the best way for payments.


Easy to use.
Getting started to use DigiByte is even easier than sending an SMS. You can send and receive DigiBytes using the devices you already know and love. All you need is installing a DigiByte supported wallet then click scan, scan the QR code and send DigiByte. As easy as 1..2..3.


Not an ICO.
DigiByte has never been funded through an ICO or significant amount of premined coins (0% remaining). There is no CEO or a company controlling the DigiByte blockchain. The founder, developers and the community are unpaid volunteers that eliminate the bankrupt risk.


Much faster.
DigiByte transactions are confirmed in approx. 15 seconds, which is 40 times faster than Bitcoin and 10 times faster than Litecoin. SegWit enables up to 1066 on-chain transactions per second and negligible fees make DigiByte the ideal currency for daily payments.

 
Always secure.
DigiByte has been built on the uncrackable technology of the Bitcoin blockchain and implemented various advanced enhancements over it such as DigiShield guard, MultiAlgo mining and the Odocrypt algorithm. Also Dandelion++ privacy protocol helps keep you safe by hiding your IP and physical location. Learn more.


Mineable.
DigiByte is a 100% Proof of Work (PoW) blockchain that can be mined with five algorithms called Sha256, Scrypt, Skein, Qubit and Odocrypt. MultiAlgo mining contributes to decentralization, security of the network and gives you the freedom to use different kind of hardware's such as an ASIC a FPGA or a GPU. Learn more.


Manageable units
Compared to 21 million Bitcoin, 21 billion DigiByte (1000:1 ratio to BTC) have been designed to be ready for mass adoption. DigiByte block rewards reduces by 1% every month instead of halving every 4 years. All 21 billion DigiByte will be mined by the year 2035. After 2035 the miners will then rely on transaction fees alone. Learn more.




A simplified way to create digital assets.
DigiAssets is a secure, scalable layer on top of the DigiByte blockchain that allows for the decentralized issuance of assets, tokens, smart contracts, digital identity and more.


Limitless possibilities.
DigiAssets can be used to securely represent anything we find in the physical world. From tangible assets such as real estate or cars, through to scarce digital pieces of art. Signed documents such as deeds and medical bills can be protected.


Growing confidently.
DigiAssets as an ecosystem and platform already has interested parties either planning on or currently building platforms in real estate, finance, remittance, identity, point of sale, racing, trade, healthcare, supply chain, government and more.


Solid technology.
DigiAssets leverages unique aspects of a truly decentralized blockchain only found within a permissionless blockchain like DigiByte. This allows DigiAssets to be more secure, scalable and decentralized than any other platform in the market.

 


Authentication at its best.
Digi-ID is a security protocol built on DigiByte blockchain technology that empowers users to effortlessly sign-in to websites, applications, and even into the internet of things.
 

Easy authentication.
Digi-ID eliminates the username, password and 2fa requirements for authentication. Because Digi-ID uses public / private key cryptography, there are no passwords or usernames at risk. This method not only protects the consumer, it also protects the services that the consumer uses.
 

Flawless security.
Digi-ID does not store any data about its users on the DigiByte blockchain. This further strengthens the security while also bolstering end-user’s confidence that their data is neither tracked nor at risk by others negligence. There is no external point of failure for an hacker to exploit your platform.


Simple and free.
Digi-ID is completely free! There are no fees, subscription services, or maintenance costs. But the cost is its second best feature. Its primary feature is that, in accordance with DigiBytes security prioritization, Digi-ID is a more secure, yet simple method available to log in to websites, apps and more.

Zano is an open-source cryptocurrency (layer-1) and ecosystem with enterprise-grade
privacy, security, and scalability that operates as a robust platform for confidential
assets and decentralized applications (dApps). 

Confidential Assets
Anyone can easily issue user-creatable privacy tokens on the Zano chain; assets
secured by the same mechanisms that make Zano so much more secure than
first-generation cryptocurrencies, namely because of hidden addresses and hidden
amounts. This unique technology can be used to create private stablecoins, shielded
versions of existing assets, and much more, without the overhead of having to create,
manage, and secure your own blockchain. 

Untraceable Transactions with hidden amounts
The transactions between Zano network members are made untraceable with the help of several technologies, most importantly d/v-CLSAG Ring Signatures and Stealth Addresses. Also, the way transaction data is stored on the blockchain allows access by parties who authorized the transactions only, and none of the private data is ever publicly published. A secure scheme with a set of proofs allows for the concealment of the amount of coins
transferred. The Bulletproofs+ technology is used for these proofs, enabling the
creation of both performance-eective and size-eective proofs. 

Burning of all fees
On Zano, all network fees are being burned. With enough network usage, the daily fee
burning could surpass the emission from block rewards, resulting in supply becoming
deflationary over time. This combination of small, minimalistic daily emissions, together with daily burns, results in little to no sell pressure on the exchanges.

Nano by design is a simple protocol with the sole purpose of being a high-performance cryptocurrency. The Nano protocol can run on low-power hardware, allowing it to be a practical, decentralized cryptocurrency for everyday use. It uses an ORV (Open Representative Voting) consensus algorithm, which is similar to PoS (Proof of Stake) but without inflationary rewards not locking of the native coin XNO.

The original Nano (RailBlocks) paper and first beta implementation were published in December, 2014, making it one of the first Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) based cryptocurrencies [6]. Soon after, other DAG cryptocurrencies began to develop, most notably DagCoin/Byteball and IOTA. These DAG-based cryptocurrencies broke the blockchain mold, improving system performance and security. Byteball achieves consensus by relying on a “main-chain” comprised of honest, reputable and user-trusted “witnesses”, while IOTA achieves consensus via the cumulative PoW of stacked transactions. Nano achieves consensus via a balance-weighted vote on conflicting transactions. This consensus system provides quicker, more deterministic transactions while still maintaining a strong, decentralized system. Nano continues this development and has positioned itself as one of the highest performing cryptocurrencies.

Nano is a trustless, feeless, low-latency cryptocurrency that utilizes a novel blocklattice structure and delegated Proof of Stake voting. The network requires minimal resources, no high-power mining hardware, and can process high transaction throughput. All of this is achieved by having individual blockchains for each account, eliminating access issues and inefficiencies of a global data-structure. We identified possible attack vectors on the system and presented arguments on how Nano is resistant to these forms of attacks.

Kadena’s public blockchain is a braided, high-throughput Proof of Work system that runs Chainweb, a protocol that delivers security and throughput. The Kadena network will unite public applications, private blockchains, and other interoperable chains in one place, driving traffic to the high-bandwidth computer at the heart of the Kadena public chain.

Kadena enterprise software is in use today by major companies in finance, healthcare, and insurance while allowing builders with a vision to skip straight from idea to product. With the launch of Kadena’s public chain, this system will support blockchain application development, from private to public and everywhere in between.
  
Kadena is solving the problems of Ethereum and is delivering features today that other blockchains have only begun to include on their roadmaps, including Formal Verification, interoperability, scalability, and more.

Kadena is live and ready for immediate deployment of production blockchain applications.

The Kadena token (KDA) is a digital currency that is used to pay for computation on the Kadena public chain. Similar to ETH on Ethereum, KDA on Kadena is the token in which miners are compensated for mining blocks on the network and is the transaction fee that users pay in order to have their transactions included in a block.

Enjin is a leading blockchain ecosystem dedicated to revolutionizing the gaming industry by integrating blockchain technology into games, applications, and businesses.
Founded in 2009 by Maxim Blagov and Witek Radomski, Enjin began as a community gaming platform of 20 million gamers. Pivoting to blockchain in 2017 and kickstarting the NFT movement, Enjin pioneered the advanced ERC-1155 token standard on Ethereum. Building upon this foundation, Enjin launched the Enjin Platform, the world's first NFT integration platform, allowing developers to seamlessly incorporate blockchain assets into their applications in less than 24 hours.
Enjin has since evolved into a comprehensive suite of blockchain products, with the Enjin Blockchain platform now powering billions of digital assets.
The Enjin Ecosystem
Enjin is a feature-rich ecosystem that covers a wide range of blockchain software products. Enjin’s tools enable developers, businesses, and individuals to create, manage, trade, distribute, and integrate NFTs with ease. Enjin's technology is used to power digital assets by millions of users world-wide.
Enjin Blockchain: A Substrate-based Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain custom-built for Non-Fungible-Tokens (NFTs) and other digital assets. Optimized for gaming, it offers high transaction throughput, low fees, and eco-friendly transactions.
Enjin Wallet: A secure, multi-functional mobile wallet supporting various cryptocurrencies and NFTs, enabling users to manage their digital assets with ease.
NFT.io Marketplace: An intuitive platform for creating, trading, and distributing NFTs, fully integrated with the Enjin Blockchain to provide a seamless user experience.
Enjin Platform API and SDKs: Developer toolkit that facilitate the integration of blockchain assets into games and applications, supporting multiple programming languages and platforms.
Enjin Beam: A QR code-based distribution system that allows for the effortless dissemination of NFTs, enhancing user engagement and marketing strategies.
Enjin Coin (ENJ)
At the core of the Enjin ecosystem is Enjin Coin (ENJ), the native governance and utility token of Enjin Blockchain. ENJ underpins all transactions, asset creation, and economic activity within the ecosystem, playing a crucial role in securing the network and empowering users to create and trade digital assets with real-world value. Key functions:
Governance & Staking: ENJ holders can stake Enjin Coin (ENJ) to participate in network governance, securing the blockchain while earning rewards for their contributions. This decentralized model ensures a fair and community-driven ecosystem.
Transaction Fees: ENJ is used to pay for all transactions on Enjin Blockchain, ensuring a seamless and unified economic model.
Security & Network Validation: ENJ is used in the nominated proof-of-stake (NPoS) consensus mechanism to secure Enjin Blockchain and allows participants to nominate reliable nodes.
NFT Minting & Creation: ENJ is used to mint NFTs and other digital assets, enabling the creation of unique, blockchain-powered items for games, applications, and virtual economies. These NFTs are verifiable, tradeable, and interoperable, allowing seamless integration across multiple platforms.
ENJ-Backed NFTs: Enjin Coin (ENJ) can be used to back NFTs, giving them a provable, on-chain reserve value. When an NFT is created using the Enjin ecosystem, developers can choose to embed ENJ within the asset, ensuring it always holds a base level of value. Holders of these NFTs have the option to melt (destroy) them at any time to recover the underlying ENJ, providing liquidity and tangible worth to digital collectibles, game items, and virtual goods.
Strategic Partnerships and Adoption
Enjin has established meaningful partnerships with leading industry players such as Microsoft, Square Enix, Samsung, and Entropia Universe, in addition to collaborating with over 150 game and app developers. These collaborations span a wide range of genres, including rewards programs, open-world fantasy RPGs, trading card games, augmented reality apps, and Minecraft servers.
Recent Developments
In September 2023, Enjin Blockchain was launched, marking a significant milestone in the ecosystem’s mission to decentralize digital asset ownership. This launch included a ""triple migration"" of tokens and NFTs across Ethereum, Polkadot, and the new Enjin Blockchain, streamlining operations and enhancing the ecosystem's efficiency.
As of May 31, 2024, 95% of Enjin Coin's total supply has been unlocked, reflecting the ecosystem's maturity and widespread adoption.
Vision for the Future
Enjin is committed to making blockchain-powered gaming accessible to everyone. By providing user-friendly tools and services, Enjin empowers developers to create immersive, player-driven economies where digital assets hold real-world value. With a focus on innovation and collaboration, Enjin aims to bring NFTs and blockchain technology to a global audience, transforming the digital landscape.

Non-Playable Coin (NPC) is a meme coin and NFT-hybrid for all 8+ billion humans on Earth. ""I support the current coin"" is the motto, a homage to the meme that first gained in popularity in 2018.

What makes your project unique?
Inspired by the non-playable character meme, NPC leans into the joke by creating an ERC20 token whose supply is the total human population as recorded on July 26, 2023. Each token is also convertible into an NFT at a rate of 1:1. Hence, it is a token with JPEG metadata that is designed to be traded both on decentralized exchanges like Uniswap (as an ERC20) and on NFT marketplaces (as an ERC1155). 

This unique design—an NFT that can also be traded as an ERC20—is called a meme fungible token (MFT). An MFT like Non-Playable Coin (NPC) links two often-separated liquidity markets, while also allowing more people than ever to own a ""part of the culture"" as NFTs. 

On the home page, users can switch between the two formats using the dApp. Users can ""respawn"" as an NFT or ""transform"" into a meme coin. The most liquid form for trading, however, is as an ERC20.

History of your project.
The project started by playing with NFT AMMs like Sudoswap and realizing that ERC1155s were not being used to explore new avenues. We also felt that the 10k+ pfp NFT collection has hit a wall because it is limited both by exclusivity and gas cost. This project seeks to demonstrate that it is possible to scale communities to millions using the ERC1155 standard, and that it is possible to unlock liquidity for such tokens by making them fungible as an ERC20. 

What’s next for your project?
Users will soon be able to accessorize their NPCs using a built-in customization tool and export their creations to be used as profile photos. Additionally, we are constructing new supporting infrastructure to better link the liquidity of ERC20 tokens with ERC1155 tokens, with NPC as the main showcase.

Positioned at the crossroads of two major ecosystems—wrapped Bitcoin solutions and liquid restaking tokens—zenBTC redefines Bitcoin interoperability and utility in DeFi.  zenBTC leverages Zenrock’s proprietary distributed MPC (dMPC) technology to eliminate centralized control over locked Bitcoin. dMPC is an advanced security layer that gives users direct, permissionless control over their digital assets. While traditional MPC is a proven, institutional-grade cryptographic standard, dMPC represents the next evolution of this technology. It is fully decentralized and operates on-chain. With dMPC, key shards are distributed across a network of independent third-party node operators, ensuring that no single entity ever holds the complete private key. Only the initial user can make a key request and complete transaction signings. This eliminates risks associated with centralized custody and the need for institutional trust. When minting zenBTC tokens, deposited Bitcoin remains locked on the Bitcoin blockchain, untouched until zenBTC is redeemed.
zenBTC’s dMPC security is underpinned by Zenrock’s native utility and governance token, $ROCK, which serves as the foundation of the entire Zenrock ecosystem.","","0.0","wrapped-tokens","solana","33.2","50.798955740808296","0.0","72.1","1329","0","29.703400000000002","0"

✓ Seasoned Asset Manager: Apollo draws on 30+ years of experience, aiming to achieve attractive returns across the risk spectrum through proprietary origination, credit strategies, and a flexible approach to borrower needs.(1)

✓ Historical Track Record of Outperformance: A diversified, global credit strategy with potential for enhanced income and attractive risk-adjusted returns across various market cycles.

✓ 0% Performance Fee

✓ $0 Redemptions

✓ Pricing Transparency: Daily pricing transparency and daily liquidity.(2)

The Underlying Fund takes a multi-asset private and public credit approach centered around five key pillars:

✓ Corporate Direct Lending: Targets large scale corporate originations and sponsor-backed issuers of first lien, senior secured and unitranche loans, utilizing Apollo’s proprietary sourcing channel.

✓ Asset-Backed Lending: Focuses on agile deployment of capital into origination and proprietary sourcing channels across a broad mandate of asset-backed investments, with a focus on investments collateralized by tangible investments.

✓ Performing Credit: Primarily pursues liquid, performing senior secured corporate credits to generate total return.

✓ Dislocated Credit: Seeks to use contingent capital to tactically pursue “dislocated” credit opportunities such as stressed, performing assets that sell-off due to technical and/or non-fundamental reasons.

✓ Structured Credit: Focuses on structured credit opportunities across diverse asset types, vintages, maturities, jurisdictions, and capital structure priorities (for example, CLOs, residential, and commercial mortgage backed securities among others).9

OnChain has had huge success in the cryptocurrency industry, as they were also the founders behind the NEO blockchain, which is now a multi-billion dollar project. Essentially, Ontology was created as a way for businesses of all sizes to install blockchain technology within their company, without having to completely change all of their current systems.

The purpose of the Ontology framework is that it is not intended to operate as a single blockchain. Instead, the technology will allow businesses to make full use of both a private and public blockchain. Each and every data transaction is confirmed in a decentralized environment, meaning that no single person or authority can take control of the network.","2018-02-26","100.0","smart contract platform","unknown","91.3","43.76643457337835","98.30994345061019","77.10000000000001","1552","2678","77.26608020771356","0"

Uniqueness of Ozone Chain

Ozone chain uses quantum random numbers (QRN) and post-quantum cryptography (PQC) to make the blockchain quantum secure and quantum resistant.

Quantum key distribution (QKD), in its current implementations has geographical limitations that constrain its usage within a few hundred kilometres. This is a huge drawback for a blockchain, where nodes need to be distributed globally and inter-node communications must span thousands of kilometres.

Thus, an architectural decision has been made to use PQC for inter-node communications, while being quantum-resistant at the same time.

Tests and Results

The quantum security technologies used in ozone chain have undergone various standardized tests and have passed all of them. The tests have been conducted by TÜV Rheinland which is an agency that provides testing and certification services to ensure the safety, quality, and performance of cybersecurity products and services, including quantum security solutions.

Entropy test
Diehard tests
NIST tests

Ozone's QRNG has also passed the NIST SP 800-22 tests, which is a test suite standards by National Institute of Standards and Technology. NIST SP 800-22 is a statistical test suite for random and pseudorandom number generators for cryptographic applications. 
•	Frequency (monobit) test
•	Frequency test within a block
•	Runs test
•	Longest run of ones in a block
•	Binary matrix rank test
•	Discrete Fourier Transform (Spectral) test
•	Non-overlapping template matching test
•	Overlapping template matching test
•	Maurer's ""Universal Statistical"" test
•	Linear complexity test
•	Serial test
•	Approximate entropy test
•	Cumulative sums (Cusums) test
•	Random excursions test
•	Random excursions variant test

How many OZO coins are there in Circulation?

The total and maximum supply is 1 billion OZO. 300 million OZO is in circulation already. The locked OZO supply is distributed over 36 months.



Ozone Chain - A Future Ready Quantum Blockchain
Building resilience against future threats is key to ensure that vital parts of the blockchain and cryptocurrency economy keep thriving. The issue is that investments for protection from medium to long-term risks are somewhat natural to overlook or dismiss, given more pressing present issues, and the costs may not seem immediately justified. It often takes some bad incidents to incentivise the necessary proactive steps.

While blockchain technology prides itself in providing a trustless system upon which the economy of digital currencies and assets operate, the underlying security mechanisms still rely on classical cryptographically processes, thus necessitating a certain level of trust in them. Ozone chain has assimilated quantum mechanical properties into its system, thus removing the trustful component of the security subsystem in blockchain, with ambitions of migrating towards of a truly trustless blockchain.","","","smart contract platform","unknown","69.6","48.81452086723066","0.0","93.30000000000001","3769","0","35.02275000000001","0"

Metaplex provides utility programs like Packs, Fusion, “Entangled” and Encrypted NFTs. Programs like Gumdrop and Hydra facilitate the distribution of tokens.
The Metaplex protocol has four components.
1. The Digital Asset Standard defines the metadata structure for non-fungible tokens (NFTs), enabling interoperability across all participants in the Solana NFT ecosystem, including NFT projects, individual NFTs, wallets, marketplace, dApps, and other protocols.
2 The Metaplex Program Library (MPL) includes multiple infrastructural protocols providing on-chain functionality for the creation, sale, purchase or trading of NFTs.
3. Advanced Developer Tools and SDKs streamline working with Metaplex, abstracting away complexity that makes blockchain development inaccessible to many. This is a key reason Metaplex is the preferred starting point for many developers getting started in the Solana ecosystem.
4. MPLX is a utility and governance token for the Metaplex Protocol. Token holders steer the direction and evolution of the protocol through the Metaplex DAO, delivering on the promise of a decentralized and community-owned creator platform.

The Request (REQ) utility token, launched in 2017, ensures the performance and stability of the Request Network. The Request Network itself is an Ethereum-based decentralized payment system where anyone can request a payment and receive money through secure means. It removes the requirement for third parties in order to provide a cheaper, more secure payment solution that works with all global currencies.

When a user creates a request for payment, they define to which address the payment needs to be allocated and what the amount is. The user can also define the terms and conditions of the payment, upgrading a simple request into an invoice. Once this is completed, the user can share their request to be paid by their counterparty.

Every step is documented and stored on the Request network, allowing everyone involved to easily keep track of all the invoices and payments for accounting purposes.

Request is also integrated with legislation across the world to remain compliant with the trade laws of each individual country.

Who Are the Founders of Request?
The founders of Request are Christophe Lassuyt and Etienne Tatur.

Christophe Lassuyt is currently the chief financial officer at Request. Before this position, he co-founded MONEYTIS.

Etienne Tatur is the chief technical officer of Request. Prior to this, he also co-founded MONEYTIS and worked as a lead developer at QOBUZ, a music streaming service.

What Makes Request Unique?
The payments on Request are performed by simply sending an invoice through the blockchain; the counterparty can then detect the request and pay it with one click in a peer-to-peer manner. The fact that the payments are push-generated instead of pull-generated is one of Request’s key advantages. There is no need for users to share their account information. The use of blockchain technology also eliminates the need for third-party processors, resulting in a reduction in transaction costs.

The Request Network leverages decentralized blockchains such as Ethereum and IPFS for an increased level of security, privacy and data ownership for the end-user. The platform does have transaction fees, which is a cost that is required to broadcast a change to the blockchain network. The transaction fees are used to incentivize miners to reach consensus on the state of the network.

REQ can be stored on wallets such as Metamask, MyEtherWallet, Ledger, imToken, Trezor, Atomic Wallet, Jaxx Liberty and Trust Wallet.

How Many Request (REQ) Coins Are There in Circulation?
REQ is an ERC-20 token that can be spent to use the Request Network.

A portion of the REQ fee is burned at a rate that is determined by the current supply and the exchange rate with other currencies.

Request’s (REQ) circulating supply is at 999,912,165 REQ as of February 2021 and the maximum supply is 999,983,984 tokens.

How Is the Request Network Secured?
REQ is an ERC-20 token based on the Ethereum platform. The requests made with REQ are stored on an immutable digital ledger. This ledger also serves as proof for all auditing purposes.","2017-10-07","","business services","ethereum","29.099999999999998","47.70803437174928","90.25164943782951","16.900000000000002","3123","2820","59.80977730324033","0"

With this new addition, Lagrange now unlocks proofs for anything – for rollups, apps, coprocessors and interoperability – as an infinite proving layer that enables anyone to prove everything at internet scale. Previously, Lagrange launched the first production-ready ZK prover network in the industry, operated by top operators including Coinbase, Kraken, OKX and more. Now, Lagrange’s ZK Prover Network is expanding to address key challenges faced by rollups and advance ZK adoption and utility.

The ZK Coprocessor can generate a proof of correct computation over arbitrary storage slots for arbitrary block ranges. For example, consider an application that wishes to compute the average on Ethereum for ETH / USDC pricing. A developer must first specify the memory slots and block range (~50,400) that they are interested in including in the data set. Next the developer writes the computations that is to be executed across the storage slots over the different blocks in parallel. Once the proof is generated, it will prove both the storage inclusion and the aggregated computation as valid with respect to a block header derived from smart contract information.","","100.0","artificial intelligence (ai)","ethereum","22.900000000000002","47.06154387768518","0.0","16.900000000000002","1339","0","15.9037","0"

UMA builds infrastructure for “priceless” financial contracts: DeFi contracts that minimize oracle usage, avoiding many of the security and scalability issues that have plagued decentralized finance. The first contracts built with UMA are priceless synthetic tokens: ERC20 tokens that can track anything while minimizing the need for on-chain price data.

The UMA project token powers the system in two ways:

Governance: UMA token holders govern what types of contracts can access the system, which asset types are supported, and key system parameters and upgrades.

Price requests: the priceless methodology minimizes on-chain price requests but doesn’t eliminate them — when contract interactions are disputed, UMA token holders fulfill price requests via the Data Verification Mechanism, or DVM.

UMA tokens enable the holder to participate in community governance and resolve contract disputes through the DVM. The tokens are not an investment opportunity.","","","business services","ethereum","32.300000000000004","42.44003972476136","96.7604148141723","16.900000000000002","1065","0","49.7603951849603","0"

Moonwell’s goal is to be the most user-friendly, fast, and secure DeFi protocol in the ecosystem. With this in mind, an emphasis was placed on having a high standard of security. Multi-signature systems are implemented for all smart contracts used by the protocol, with the expert cyber-security team at Halborn Security auditing all contracts before deployment. Additionally, there is a generous bounty program through a partnership with the trusted team at ImmuneFi, which allows security researchers to submit their findings for review and earn a bounty for discovering security vulnerabilities.

It has both Automated Market Maker (AMM)-based and orderbook-based exchanges. 

zkRollup is an Ethereum L2 scaling solution that migrates computations off the blockchain. Loopring protocol only uses the underlying Ethereum blockchain as a data layer and a verification layer. As a result, Loopring's throughput is as high as 2,025 trades per second compared to Ethereum’s current throughput of 15 transactions per second. The result is that the cost per trade settlement is as small as $0.00015.

Loopring's performance is sufficient for professional traders and market makers to deploy algorithmic strategies and other automated trading bots. This was not previously possible on any DEX as it was prohibitively slow and expensive. By building on top of Loopring 3.0, orderbook-based DEXs can be commercially viable for the first time. Loopring expects non-custodial exchanges can begin to outcompete and displace many centralized counterparts.","2017-08-01","","decentralized exchange (dex)","ethereum","82.0","42.30783787257836","96.63462666280583","55.400000000000006","1051","2887","71.94024433198204","0"

In more traditional blockchains, the host provides the food/drinks (i.e resources) for this party. And when the guests arrive, the amount of resources can only accommodate so many people, the portions are small and then everything eventually runs out and the party ends. Think Constellation DAG like a potluck (a party where everyone brings food/drinks). With every added guest (node to the network), the more resources the party has to keep going. This is the nature of Constellation, a distributed system that scales horizontally.

Is Constellation a Blockchain?
Not exactly. Although inspired by the principles of decentralization, many standard blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum face scalability issues. This is why the next, generation of decentralized networks such as Hashgraph, IOTA, and Constellation have turned to DAG.

What is a Microservice?
“Microservices” is an approach to application development in which a large application is built as a suite of modular services. Each module supports a specific business goal and uses a simple, well-defined interface to communicate with other sets of services. Uber, for example, is not a singular app purse. It is a unified app which means it is a single interface that brings together their driver app, their rider app, and their corporate team app.","","100.0","smart contract platform","base","84.1","42.21410130825114","93.75543128690539","73.6","1332","0","62.89295095041689","0"

Metis: A Multi-Network Ecosystem Redefining Decentralized Infrastructure​
Metis is more than a Layer 2 - it is a multi-network ecosystem powered by the groundbreaking MetisSDK. Metis is building the future of decentralized infrastructure with a dual-network architecture: Andromeda for secure, general-purpose dApps and Hyperion for high-performance, AI-optimized execution. Both chains interoperate seamlessly, enabling builders to deploy scalable, efficient, and intelligent Web3 applications across sectors such as DeFi, gaming, DEPIN and AI.

What Is Andromeda ?
Andromeda​​ serves as the foundational optimistic rollup network within the Metis ecosystem, delivering scalable decentralized infrastructure with Ethereum-level security and enhanced throughput. Optimized for DeFi, gaming, and general-purpose applications, it leverages a decentralized sequencer network and fraud-proof mechanisms to prioritize reliability and proven execution over extreme performance. Its battle-tested architecture supports a growing ecosystem of protocols requiring robust security models.

Andromeda will evolve alongside Hyperion, maintaining its core focus on secure general-purpose infrastructure. Key upgrades like on-chain data availability and fraud-proof refinements will advance its capabilities, with a roadmap targeting Stage 0 deployment soon and Stage 1 completion by year-end. As Metis’ cornerstone network, it remains the go-to solution for projects valuing decentralization (via full DSEQ nodes) and time-tested security frameworks.


What Is Hyperion ?
Hyperion：The First Layer 2 Bringing On-Chain LLMs to Life
Hyperion is a high-performance, AI-optimized Layer 2 solution designed to scale AI, DeFi, Depin and gaming applications. It enhances Metis' ecosystem by introducing parallel execution, AI-native infrastructure and decentralized sequencing, while maintaining Ethereum security and METIS as the gas token.

We aim to empower on-chain decentralized applications (dApps) with improved network bandwidth while securing the L1 at the same time.

Our goal is to provide dApps on Solana with a greater likelihood of securing block space and prioritizing transaction inclusion.

sSOL is the universal liquidity layer for delegates [dApps] and LRTs on Solayer. Every unit of SOL can be perceived as a unit of blockspace lent towards dApps, securing network bandwidth and TPS.

The stake delegated towards dApps, which derives an AVS SPL token, is built on top of sSOL-SOL liquidity. Similarly, LRTs are built on top of sSOL liquidity interface to generate vault strategies.

There are various ways of utilizing sSOL and earning maximum yield as an sSOL holder. You can delegate to dApps to bootstrap network bandwidth or participate in DeFi strategies to earn additional APY, starting with our launch partners.

There are various ways of utilizing sSOL and earning maximum yield as an sSOL Holder. You can delegate to dApps to bootstrap network bandwidth or participate in DeFi strategies to earn additional APY, starting with our launch partners.

Now we will go through a couple of examples on how you can put your sSOL to work in AMMs, lending protocols, perpetual exchanges, and more.

​
Liquidity Vaults on Kamino
Kamino’s liquidity vaults are an automated liquidity solution that allows users to earn yield on their crypto assets by providing liquidity to concentrated liquidity market makers (CLMMs).

A vault deploys liquidity into an underlying DEX pool, consisting of 2 tokens. When you deposit into a vault, you earn fees from trading volume.

In other words, if you deposit into a pool with sSOL and SOL, any token swaps that utilize that pool will incur a small cost to the swapper. As a Kamino depositor, you earn from that swap fee.

Vault Capital Deposit Example

Situation: You have 100 sSOL worth $10,000 USD. You want to earn yield on your assets without active management.

Use Case: Deposit your sSOL into a Kamino vault. Your sSOL will provide liquidity to a DEX, earning fees from trading volume. Kamino automates rebalancing and compounding, maximizing your yield.

Benefit: Earn yield passively while maintaining exposure to sSOL.

​
Liquidity Provision on Orca
Orca utilizes a Concentrated Liquidity Automated Market Maker (CLAMM) to enhance capital efficiency and yield for liquidity providers. By providing liquidity to Orca’s pools, users can earn yield on their crypto assets through trading fees.

When you provide liquidity to an Orca pool, such as the sSOL-SOL pair, you earn fees from each token swap within that pool. This means if you deposit sSOL and SOL into the pool, any trades that occur between these tokens will generate fees, which are distributed to you as a liquidity provider. Orca automates this process, ensuring optimal capital efficiency and low slippage.

LP Example

Situation: You have 100 sSOL worth $10,000 USD. You want to earn yield on your assets without active management.

Use Case: Deposit your sSOL and an equivalent amount of SOL into an Orca CLAMM pool. Your sSOL and SOL will provide liquidity to the DEX, earning fees from trading volume. Orca’s advanced CLAMM technology will ensure that your assets are utilized efficiently, maximizing your returns.

Benefit: Earn yield passively from trading fees while maintaining exposure to both sSOL and SOL.","","","solana ecosystem","solana","10.100000000000001","45.220836410997876","54.39915404285176","16.900000000000002","3504","0","34.96200391499812","0"

The business value of AI is becoming clearer each day; however, there’s a significant gap between the people developing AI tools (researchers and academics) and the businesses that want to use them. Most organizations need a more customized solution than what a single AI project can offer, and research projects oftentimes have trouble accessing a large enough data set to build effective machine learning. SingularityNET closes these gaps.

The long-term vision of the SingulairtyNET team is to build a network of complex AI Agent interactions primarily using resources from the OpenCog Foundation. To look at this further, let’s check out their in-house built humanoid robot, Sophia. Sophia uses a combination of AI Agents that range from natural language processing to physical motor controls to operate. You tell Sophia to summarize a video that’s embedded in a webpage. To do this, Sophia sends a request to Agent A. Through its AI, Agent A knows that Agent B specializes in analyzing and transcribing video while Agent C specializes in summarizing text. Agent A pays Agent B and Agent C to perform these tasks while Sophia pays Agent A to coordinate. All the while, each Agent has updated their own AI with the network information gained from these tasks and combines it with their previous experiences and knowledge. Therefore, the collective AI of the system grows at a faster rate than any individual Agent.

SingularityNET wants to build a decentralized protocol for creators and users of AI to interact with each other, to not only help individual projects benefit by leveraging the strengths of other AI systems that might handle certain tasks better, but ultimately to develop SingularityNET into a functioning AI system itself, with nodes on the network making their own decisions about how to connect services and proactively provide solutions to academic and business problems. Tokenizing the network creates an AI marketplace where AI developers and sellers can not only link with others who might assist in building more robust AI solutions, but also allow AI services and products to be bought and sold, creating revenue and establishing price points where none have existed before.

The SingularityNET team boasts 50+ AI developers and 10+ PhDs. Dr. Ben Goertzel leads the group as CEO and Chief Scientist. He’s also the Chairman of the OpenCog Foundation and the Artificial General Intelligence Society, as well as the Chief Scientist at Hanson Robotics, the partner company helping bring SingularityNET to life. Dr. David Hanson, founder of Hanson Robotics, serves as the Robotics Lead. Most famously, Hanson Robotics built Sophia, the most expressive humanoid robot to date. Sophia is also a proud member of the SingularityNET team. The team recently released the alpha version of the platform and is planning on launching a public beta sometime in the middle of 2018.","2017-12-21","100.0","artificial intelligence (ai)","ethereum","44.7","42.40947579467709","0.0","75.2","2978","2745","42.59625","0"

Existing reward systems often suffer from issues such as centralized management, limited usability, and a lack of tangible economic value, all of which hinder long-term user participation.

BugsCoin is a digital asset developed  based on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) network that leverages blockchain technology to address these challenges. It is designed to provide users with greater transparency and fairness in transactions and rewards. Through BugsCoin, users can engage in meaningful economic activities beyond mere point accumulation and can directly contribute to decision-making within the community.

To realize this vision, the online platform ""AntTalk,"" which allows for simulated investments in digital assets, has transitioned its existing reward system to BugsCoin. This shift enables the AntTalk community to foster long-term user engagement, laying the groundwork for the platform's continued growth.

The BugsCoin project aims to build a user-centric, decentralized economic system, with plans to expand from ""AntTalk"" to the global market. Through this initiative, users are expected to participate more actively in the platform and contribute to its growth.","","","retail","binance-smart-chain","37.6","47.235938848693024","0.0","36.7","1307","0","20.852800000000002","0"

The team is based in the United Kingdom but has a decentralized structure with members spreading across the world. Several people on their management team are well-versed in enterprise software development using .NET and C# – a positive sign considering those are the project’s two primary languages. Chris Trew, the founder and CEO, has over 10 years of experience in enterprise IT and was a volunteer developer for the Blitz project. Stratis is competing against other BaaS projects in an increasingly saturated but gigantic space. Lisk may be the largest direct competitor in offering sidechains for businesses. However, Lisk is written in Javascript (not C#) and has sidechains that are more publicly available. The decreased privacy may be a turnoff to corporations looking to keep their code proprietary. The company held an ICO in June 2016 and manage to raised 915 Bitcoin.","2016-08-09","","smart contract platform","unknown","27.200000000000003","46.41609632315738","89.81442361571308","16.900000000000002","1704","3244","60.42034826549958","0"

To stake, users simply need to head to the stS page and select how much S they wish to deposit.

Led by a team of proven founders and backed by $40 million from world-class investors, including Sequoia and Matrix, IOST aims to be the underlying architecture for the future of online services.

The powerful consensus algorithm “Proof-of-Believability” enables next-gen transaction throughput speeds while ensuring nodes stay compliant, using factors including IOST token balance, reputation-based token balance, network contributions and user behaviors. A faster grade Byzantine Fault Tolerance mechanism, microstate blocks, Atomic Commit protocol and a dynamic sharding protocol (Efficient Distributed Sharding) all ensure transactions are safeguarded, consistent and lightning fast while reducing storage, configuration costs and processing power for validators. 

Anyone is able to participate in every layer of our system, from using services on our blockchain to running a node and validating transactions. Our rules and code are open for all to see and no preconditions will limit participation. IOST aims to fundamentally disrupt previous methods of business by creating a self-operated, trustless network that maximizes network value for all parties. The project places great emphasis on decentralized and secure ways of storing information. It also provides for Dapps and smart contracts, and anyone who is familiar with blockchain technology knows just how integral these two concepts have become.

Adhering to the quintessential egalitarian values of blockchain technology, IOST is creating a censorship-resistant and trustless network that is open to all, using blockchain technology to cut out middlemen and maximize network value for all parties. 

Terrace Wang, Kimmy Zhong, and Ray Xiao, who are extremely brilliant, have co-founded the project. In addition to these original three, the project has 12 employees and 4 advisors. It is also worth noting that Ryan Bubiski, a co-founder of CodeAcademy and a winner of Times Most Influential People award plays a major role in the advisory board of the project.

Ardor provides the blockchain infrastructure for businesses and institutions to leverage the strengths of blockchain technology without having to invest in developing custom blockchain solutions. Instead, Ardor offers a main chain that handles blockchain security and decentralization plus customizable child chains that come ready to use, right out of the box, for various business applications. Ardor goes beyond Nxt to solve critical issues of blockchain bloat, scalability, and customization.

Nxt is a well respected, verified, and established blockchain technology with a comparatively long history and an experienced development team. However, as blockchain usage increases over the coming years Nxt, and other blockchain technologies, will face some fundamental problems with payments, scalability, and customization. The first and most straightforward problem is the use of native tokens for transaction fees. Nxt uses a forging proof of stake system, meaning that the total token supply has already been created and new tokens aren’t created with each block. Instead, the forgers that verify the blocks receive a portion of the transaction fees paid on the network. As such, the transaction fees need to be paid in NXT, even if you’ve created a new currency that’s independent of Nxt, you’ll still need to own NXT in order to pay miners, diluting the value of your own currency. 

To test Ardor’s capabilities and serve as an example of an operating child chain, the Ardor developers have created Ignis. Ignis will implement all of the customizable features that come from the Nxt code base. Essentially, Ignis will be a proof of concept and could be the first of many more child chains on the Ardor platform. The Ignis ICO recently raised $15 million in funding for development. In the future, Ardor child chains could be used to create equity trading platforms, digital file transfer services, private enterprise blockchain applications, and many more use cases. Ardor’s strengths are quick time to setup and wide customizability, making it a great option for companies looking to leverage blockchain without the resources to dedicate to custom development.

Ardor has many architectural advantages. One of them and perhaps the most influential one is that it has been created using Java; one of the most widespread programming languages in the world today. This is definitely a step in the right direction seeing as it becomes ten times easier for a commercial application to succeed if the development language is one which most programmers can relate to.","2018-01-01","","infrastructure","unknown","23.799999999999997","44.50388983656084","71.61611505429596","16.900000000000002","2676","2734","53.03554026900359","0"

Clearpool introduces a dynamic interest model driven by market supply and demand forces.

Liquidity providers on Clearpool can earn attractive yields, with pool interest rates enhanced by additional LP rewards paid in CPOOL - Clearpool's utility and governance token.

Clearpool LP tokens, called cpTokens, are the building blocks for a system of tokenized credit that will provide Clearpool LPs with risk management and hedging capabilities.

As more institutions begin to realize the benefits that decentralized finance can bring to their organizations, Clearpool will provide the new architecture to facilitate flows between the $120 trillion traditional capital markets, and the burgeoning DeFi ecosystem.

The CPOOL Token

- CPOOL is the utility and governance token for the Clearpool protocol.
- CPOOL holders will vote on the whitelisting of new borrowers, a process that will qualify participants to earn additional CPOOL through an incentive reward scheme.
- Eventually, a full system of decentralized governance will be introduced, allowing CPOOL holders to propose, vote and implement future changes and upgrades to the protocol.
- CPOOL staking will be a required action for borrowers, who must stake an amount of CPOOL to access the area of the protocol where they can make a proposal to be whitelisted.
Liquidity providers earn additional CPOOL rewards, enhancing pool interest rates to attractive levels.
- Clearpool will announce a buyback program, where a share of protocol revenue will be used to buy CPOOL in the open market, to perpetually sustain reward pools.","","50.0","decentralized finance (defi)","ethereum","61.7","38.9519898158276","0.0","75.5","1743","0","30.561125","0"

The reason it was created was to create a truly private cryptocurrency. The founder of Verge felt that Bitcoin wasn’t anonymous, so he decided to build a new blockchain where transactions could not be traced. Verge uses multiple anonymity-centric networks such as TOR and I2P. The IP addresses of the users are fully obfuscated. The Core QT wallet has built-in TOR integration as well as SSL encryption which adds an extra level of security.

Verge is an open source project with an active team of developers from all over the world. The development team is always in close contact with the community. Verge is not a private company funded through an ICO or premining. Wraith Protocol is a technology upgrade package that enables our users to be able to send and receive payments privately across our blockchain by enabling stealth addressing services.   Additionally this update removes our QT wallet users off of clearnet and migrates everyone to SSL enabled Tor.

Verge focuses on security and maintaining user anonymity just like Monero; so that is its latent upside. Many investors are also applauding its unique technology. Having been improved and integrated with the Wraith Protocol technology, verge users are now able to effortlessly switch between private and public ledgers on the Verge blockchain.

Before this, private and public ledgers were mutually selected, meaning that they could not co-exist on a very similar blockchain. But investors are today free to use whatever ledger they want. A good example was when Wraith Protocol switched ON – one will not be able to view the transaction data, not even via the blockchain explorer. Additionally, Verge makes obscure the IP addresses in both instances. When coupled with Wraith Protocol Verge certainly becomes the only undetectable cryptocurrency.

Furthermore, transaction speed on Verge is light speed at 5 seconds only, using Simple Payment Verification technology. Verge also maintains a community feel since it’s not a private company. Community members are responsible for the direction of its technology and where the coin heads next. It currently offers a number of secure mobile wallets, including the Tor Android Wallet, which offers mobile anonymity, another big plus over Bitcoin.

Verges offers five different Proof-of-Work algorithms for mining. They include; Lyra2rev2, Scrypt, X17, blake2s and myr-groestl. Offering a choice of five different algorithms promotes inclusion, since a wider variety of users will now have an opportunity to not only mine but influence the network. Should one algorithm demand greater mining resources, users get an option of just switching to a different one.","2014-10-09","100.0","smart contract platform","unknown","80.60000000000001","40.80934594774328","98.86746121896198","50.2","2772","3914","72.14926142663668","0"

It has developed a blockchain-based platform that enables the tracking and trading of energy, flexibility services and environmental commodities. Its goal is to provide the platform for a fully modernised, market-driven grid that offers consumers a choice in their energy while driving the democratisation of power.
Headquartered in Zug, Switzerland, Powerledger operates in more than 10 countries. Powerledger operates on two blockchain layers; the POWR token is issued on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token, and the Powerledger blockchain - a native Solana based blockchain to process energy transactions on a more scalable network. 


The POWR token is an ERC-20 token that acts as a licence required for businesses such as; utilities, renewable energy operators, microgrids, companies committed to 100% renewable energy and property developers to access Powerledger’s platform, and will be able to be used to pay for transactions on the Powerledger blockchain in future. In 2015, 30 countries had reached grid parity, meaning that the price of solar-generated energy was equal to or less than the cost of local retail electricity. Powerledger combines renewable energy and blockchain technology to offer energy solutions that are cheaper and more sustainable than traditional energy alternatives.


Powerledger was founded in 2016 to solve a pressing problem: Energy that comes from solar and wind is intermittent and lacks the steady quality that fossil fuels provide, and this causes problems for the grid.
Powerledger’s approach was to create a highly agile market that could help regulate this intermittency and start to create a transition to a more responsive, distributed network with better storage. Powerledger’s software is used by utilities and large corporations to track, trace, and trade every kilowatt of energy to improve grid stability.

The Flux ecosystem is devoted to empowering everyone to develop, deploy and use the decentralized Internet of the future: Web3.

At this moment, the Flux ecosystem consists of: a native, mineable PoW cryptocurrency ($FLUX); the powerful decentralized computational Flux Network (FluxNodes); a Linux-based operating system (FluxOS); the Flux blockchain, which enables on-chain governance, economics, and parallel assets for interoperability with other blockchains and DeFi access; and finally, the Flux products — FluxAI, FluxCloud, FluxEdge, Zelcore Wallet, the SSP multisig browser wallet, and FusionX, the ultimate swap aggregator.

Currently (2025/5) Flux has a computational network consisting of around 11,500 decentralized nodes, distributed globally with more than 96,000 CPU cores, 230 terabytes of RAM and over 6.1 petabytes of storage.

Ergo is designed for developing decentralized applications with the main focus of providing an efficient, secure and easy way to implement financial contracts. To achieve  this  goal, Ergo includes various technical and economic improvements to existing blockchain solutions. Every coin in Ergo is protected by  a program in Ergo Script, which is a powerful and protocol-friendly scripting language based on Σ-protocols. Using ErgoScript, users can encode the conditions under which coins may be used: who can spend them, when, under what external conditions, to whom, and so on. Extended support for light nodes makes Ergo friendly for end users because it allows running contracts on untrusted commodity hardware.To be usable in the long-term, Ergo follows a survivability approach – it uses widely-researched solutions that do not result in security issues in the future, while also preventing performance degradation over time with a new economic model. Finally, Ergo has a self-amendable protocol that allows it to absorb new ideas and improve itself in the future.","","91.67","smart contract platform","unknown","77.7","50.980887383057684","97.2391435490527","73.1","1110","0","63.98005024216844","0"

peaq is a layer-1 blockchain powering the Machine Economy. It is designed to power Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePINs) and the billions of devices, robots and vehicles (RWAs) that run on them. At the time of launch, peaq is home to over 50 DePINs in 20+ industries. 

What is DePIN? 
Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) is the name for decentralized applications that use tokens to incentivise communities to build physical infrastructure networks (think mobility, electric vehicle charging, telecoms etc.) from the ground up.

More on DePIN: https://www.peaq.network/blog/what-are-decentralized-physical-infrastructure-networks-depin 

Why do DePINs build on peaq?
peaq is designed to power real-world Web3 applications. peaq’s Modular DePIN Functions — which include Machine IDs and DePIN Data Verification — work as building blocks DePINs leverage to speed up their development and deployment. 

peaq’s DePIN ecosystem enables DePINs to explore synergies with peers, peaq’s DePIN-focused enterprise ecosystem gives DePINs opportunities to expand their demand side, and peaq’s fundamentals give them affordable and fast transactions as well as a high degree of decentralization.

Paxos was the first virtual currency company to receive a charter from the New York State Department of Financial Services. As a chartered limited purpose trust company with fiduciary powers under the Banking Law, Paxos is able to offer regulated services in the crypto-asset and virtual commodities space.

The Paxos team comes from a wide variety of backgrounds with a diverse array of experiences ranging from Wall Street to Silicon Valley. It’s led by CEO and co-founder Charles Cascarilla, who has spent his career as a customer, analyst, investor and now creator of financial technology.

Paxos describes itself as “the first regulated Trust company with blockchain expertise”, and it is using that expertise to create a modern settlement solution that can eliminate risk and simplify settlements. What many people may not know about Paxos is that it was actually founded in 2012 as Paxos Trust Company, and that for most of its life it ran the cryptocurrency exchange itBit, which is still operates. The creation of Paxos was a pivot from an exchange platform to a company focused on creating a modern settlement platform using blockchain technology.

Paxos has become the most widely adopted cryptocurrency in the fastest time frame, with support from over 20 exchanges and OTC desks in the first five weeks of its existence. It’s been picked up and listed by six of the top ten cryptocurrency exchanges, Binance, OKEx, Gate.io, ZB, KuCoin and DigiFinex. These exchanges are offering PAX as an alternative to the controversial Tether. Unlike the controversy surrounding the people who control Tether, there is no such obscurity when it comes to the people behind Paxos. The CEO and co-founder is Charles Cascarilla. He has over 15 years in financial services and has co-founded Cedar Hill asset management back in 2005. He has also worked and Bank of America and Goldman Sachs prior to that.

The Pax Dollar (USDP) is the first digital asset to be issued by a financial institution and to be fully secured by the U.S. dollar. While other similar stablecoins have existed, there has been no proof of full U.S. dollar reserves, nor have these earlier assets been issued by a financial institution. The Paxos team has been fairly clear in declaring the different base that PAX is working from.

ArcBlock brings great technological advancements that will open the third generation of blockchain applications.

Arcblock work by bridging the gap between different blockchains and their respective ecosystems has not been easy. There are some solutions which attempt to solve this problem, but it is evident there is plenty of room for competition in this regard. Building an open chain access layer capable of spanning multiple new and existing blockchains is a very interesting business model.

Building a new ecosystem meant to connect various chains will not be easy. As of right now, the team has completed its token sale, and the first public release candidate for the Open Chain Access Protocol will be released in Q3. Early 2019 will herald the introduction of more technical features and an Ethereum Blocklet prototype.","","75.0","artificial intelligence (ai)","ethereum","56.00000000000001","41.12907658201829","85.05299279634613","56.00000000000001","1166","0","55.441397478721136","0"

What makes your project unique?

Combining the benefits of digital assets with the benefits of real investments in agricultural land
History of your project.
03/2023

What’s next for your project?
APF GROUP is a family-owned company primarily engaged in investments in agricultural land in the Czech Republic. We currently own agricultural land with a total value of over CZK 100 million. The purchase of land is carried out continuously on the basis of predetermined parameters (location, area, location of the land in the cadastral area, land quality, lease conditions, other legal defects). The long-term goal is to gradually consolidate the land in each locality into whole blocks of land intended for agricultural use in cooperation with tenants (farmers and agricultural companies).

What can your token be used for?
The funds raised through the ICO (Initial Coin Offering) of the APFC token will be used in accordance with the long-term strategy of APF GROUP and will offer clients the opportunity to participate in specific projects in the future. At the same time, the APFC project may offer an alternative for other agricultural investors from other countries and continents to secure funding for their projects.

They aim to create an entire ecosystem of linked chains and a virtual spiderweb of endless use-cases that make ARK highly flexible, adaptable, and scalable. ARK is a secure platform designed for mass adoption and will deliver the services that consumers want and developers need. It is fast, decentralized, scalable, collaborative, bridging and open-source. The ARK Desktop Wallet is natively built for all major Operating Systems. ARK wallets connect to fully synced network peers removing the need to download the full blockchain.

ARK operates using a Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus algorithm. Unlike Bitcoin, in which miners with expensive rigs secure network transactions, the ARK network is secured by delegates. There are hundreds of potential delegates, but token holders in the ARK ecosystem continuously vote on who actually gets to be an active, forging delegate. Only 51 delegates make the cut. As a token holder, you’re only allowed to vote for one delegate at a time. The fee to vote/unvote is just 1 ARK, so it’s advantageous to at least vote once for a delegate you support. The more ARK tokens you own, the more powerful your vote.

ARK was launched in February of this year by 27 members spread across the world. With team members located everywhere from California to Bulgaria – the ARK Crew is truly decentralized. The team currently consists of 15 core members. The ARK infrastructure is modeled heavily on that of three older projects: Bitshares, Crypti, and Lisk. In fact, some of the ARK developers were previously developers on some of those projects. Francois-Xavier (FX) Thoorens, the CTO, was a core developer at Lisk in 2016.

Ark Community
A diverse group of people and skill sets, including Full Stack and Web Developers, Network Engineers, Hardware Experts, Money Managers, Musicians, Traders, Social Media Promoters, and Business Owners, uniting to realize a vision shared by 30 members of the ARK Crew. All passionately devoted to collaboration and the development of the ARK ecosystem and community.

Ark Token
Secured by a cryptographic blockchain network similar to Lisk and Crypti, running on a Delegated Proof of Stake Consensus Algorithm developed by Bitshares. ARK DPoS provides a newly adapted voting system and incorporates many improvements over previous DPoS implementations.

SmartBridge
To increase the reach of the ARK platform, ARK bridges together useful and proprietary blockchains through the use of ARK SmartBridges. These SmartBridges allow for communication among validated bridged blockchains with the ability to perform tasks and advanced functions. Through the use of SmartBridges, the ARK Crew is able to connect many popular blockchains and finally create a unifying bond among different ecosystems. As examples, the first blockchains the ARK Crew will bridge are: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Lisk, 3rd Party Anonymous Network Integration, one or more proprietary gaming economy tokens (Codename: A***** [Ticker: A***]), and numerous other bridges connecting new and already existing blockchains in the future. 

Security
Because we understand security is a major point of concern for everyone, cryptographic and security principals are incorporated throughout the entire Development Life Cycle to guarantee a secure core meeting the requirements and expectations of our users. Through continuous risk analysis and internal recurring penetration testing, we provide a system that fulfills the high standards required by this type of environment. 

Privacy
ARK Anonymous Network Integration provides ARK users with optional privacy when sending ARK transactions throughout all of the services developed for the ARK platform. Anonymization services could be potentially provided by a 3rd Party technology integration Partnership.

Self-Sustaining
The ARK Crew has a mission to make blockchain technology easily accessible to consumers​, even to the point where consumers do not know that they are using it. We not only develop the tools bridging the virtual with reality, but also provide the unique services consumers want, understand, and are willing to purchase using ARK. The ARK Crew develops additional platforms and services benefiting from the ARK technology, providing online and offline revenue streams for the ARK Platform, and leading to faster research and development of new and exciting ways to encourage consumer participation, educating them about blockchain technology, while simultaneously adding value to the ARK coin. By incorporating revenue streams into our projects, the ARK Crew can provide even more unique services for user adoption as we grow.","","","unknown","unknown","68.10000000000001","45.348408039662594","97.05185068271517","48.0","4739","0","57.666947738950306","0"

Bancor is an ecosystem of decentralized, open-source protocols that promote on-chain trading and liquidity. 

Its main protocol, Carbon, is a decentralized trading protocol allowing users to perform automated trading strategies using custom on-chain limit orders and range orders, with the option of combining orders together to create automated buy low, sell high strategies. 

Fast Lane, a separate open-source arbitrage protocol, allows any user to perform arbitrage between Bancor ecosystem protocols and external on-chain exchanges and redirect arbitrage profits back to the Bancor ecosystem.

All Bancor ecosystem protocols are governed by the BancorDAO via staked BNT.

What makes Bancor Unique?
Bancor’s flagship protocol, Carbon, allows users to perform automated trading strategies on-chain with far greater control and efficiency compared to existing decentralized exchanges (DEXs).

Existing on-chain liquidity solutions suffer from key drawbacks, namely that: 1) executed orders can be reversed when prices move, and 2) a single liquidity position must execute both buys and sells using the same pricing curve. As a result, on-chain liquidity is costly and complex to automate and update, while exposing traders to MEV sandwich attacks.

Carbon introduces a new form of on-chain liquidity called Asymmetric Liquidity, which allows users to create individual liquidity positions with two distinct pricing curves: one for buying and one for selling. This gives users the ability to set buy and sell orders that execute in specific price ranges, with the option of combining orders together to create automated buy low, sell high strategies. By design, Carbon orders are irreversible on execution, easily adjustable directly on-chain, and completely resistant to MEV sandwich attacks. These capabilities give users an unprecedented level of control and automation to perform novel trading strategies on-chain.

For example, a user who believes ETH will trade in the near future between $1500-2000 could set a Carbon strategy that automatically buys ETH between $1500-1600 and sells the ETH from $1900-2000. As market prices move into selected ranges, orders are automatically executed by traders who interact with Carbon directly, or via popular DEX aggregators. All with no reliance on external oracles or keepers. Strategy updates can be made in a highly gas efficient manner, without needing to withdraw and re-add liquidity, via parameters in a strategy’s smart contract.

Carbon also improves on the trading model in centralized exchanges by allowing users to create multi-order strategies that utilize a single source of rotating liquidity to fill trades, eliminating the need to create multiple limit orders and pre-fund each order as it is created.
By fusing the feature-rich trading functionality of centralized exchanges with the access and transparency of automated market-makers, Carbon unlocks the future of decentralized on-chain trading.

History of Bancor
Bancor invented the first blockchain-based automated market maker (AMM) in 2017. The protocol’s first version was launched in June 2017, with subsequent protocol versions iterating on the original AMM model.

In 2020, the BancorDAO was launched to oversee and govern development of Bancor ecosystem protocols. The BancorDAO has since voted on over 450 governance proposals, and has had at the time writing over 9,700 governance token holders, and over 1,100 voters.

What’s Next for Bancor
Per the BancorDAO, the Bancor community is focused on development of its flagship protocols, Carbon and Fast Lane. The beta version of Fast Lane is currently live on Ethereum mainnet, and will continue evolving, while the beta version of Carbon is expected to go live on Ethereum mainnet in the second quarter of 2023, pending voting by the BancorDAO. From there, deployment of both Carbon and Fast Lane on other Layer-1 and Layer-2 blockchains will be explored. 

The Bancor community will continue executing on its mission to build innovative solutions that expand the design space for on-chain trading and liquidity and open the doors to a wide range of future DeFi applications and products.

What Can Bancor (BNT) Be Used For
The Bancor Network Token (BNT) can currently be staked for vBNT to vote in BancorDAO governance, with additional BNT utility controlled by the BancorDAO.

What is Chromia?
Chromia is an open source public blockchain conceived of by Swedish company Chromaway AB. The Chroma token (CHR) was launched in May of 2019. The technology behind the Chromia blockchain is adapted from an earlier technology called ‘Postchain’, a solution provided by Chromaway AB for enterprise clients. 

How does Chromia work?
Chromia is a standalone Layer-1 blockchain and EVM compatible Layer-2 enhancement for Binance Smart Chain and Ethereum. It is designed to enhance existing dApps and allow for the creation of next-generation dApps by providing scalability, improved data handling, and customizable fee structures. The blockchain uses a unique architecture called relational blockchain, as well as a custom programming language called Rell.

Rell is designed to code and function very similarly to SQL, allowing developers to leverage the security and immutability of blockchain while storing and handling data with the efficiency of a relational database.  Each dApp running on Chromia operates on its own sidechain which is rooted in the main blockchain. This allows each application to scale more efficiently and gives each application developer the freedom to choose from a variety of fee structures. For example, one application may require users to pay transaction fees in CHR (similar to how Ethereum or Bitcoin work), while another application could stake enough CHR to reserve computational power and allow their users to make unlimited transactions without paying any fees at all. 

What applications have been built on Chromia?
Chromia already has a wide variety of applications building upon their blockchain, using their chain as a decentralized storage layer, and using their Layer-2 enhancements. These applications range from DeFi options trading platform Hedget, to open world farming game My Neighbor Alice, to government land registry initiative LAC PropertyChain.  One of the latest features in development is a new NFT standard called Chromia Originals, which will operate both as a native standard on Chromia’s chain as well as an enhancement layer for existing ERC-721 and BEP-721 tokens. Work on these Layer-2 enhancements are being developed in cooperation with My Neighbor Alice.

Who is behind Chromia?
Chromia’s core team consists of industry veterans Or Perelman, Henrik Hjelte and Alex Mizrahi. All three have deep roots in the crypto space, going back to the early days of Bitcoin and Ethereum. For example, Alex published several early academic papers on Proof of Stake consensus and was also one of the key figures behind Colored Coins, one of the first projects to develop the idea of ‘tokens’ that would later be brought to prominence by Ethereum.

In summary, Chromia is a Layer-1 and Layer-2 blockchain solution under active development, with the goal of delivering enhanced features and data handling and storage capabilities to decentralized applications.","","","artificial intelligence (ai)","ethereum","72.0","46.4081737627931","0.0","87.1","2938","0","33.4711","0"

Sophon is an innovative consumer entertainment platform dedicated to onboarding the next generation of crypto users through everyday useful products that monetize and reward the data we all naturally produce.
Built as a modular rollup powered by the ZK Stack, Sophon creates an intuitive ecosystem where users can engage with gaming, social, AI, prediction markets, and more without the typical complexities of blockchain technology. Through zkTLS technology, Sophon transforms everyday online activities into valuable assets that users can control and benefit from while maintaining privacy.
This consumer-focused platform bridges traditional applications and blockchain benefits, providing both a developer framework and a user hub for crypto-powered consumer experiences.

What is the project about?
Sophon differentiates itself through several key innovations:
User-Centric Design: Sophon prioritizes beautiful, simple, and accessible experiences, making blockchain technology invisible to end users while delivering its benefits.
Social Oracle: Leveraging zkTLS technology, Sophon's Social Oracle verifies and brings online achievements, reputation, and social influence onchain without revealing personal data. This transforms scattered social signals into collective intelligence that powers applications.
Native Account Abstraction: Users can sign up with familiar methods like Google or Apple accounts, creating self-custodial wallets in the background without the complexities of traditional crypto onboarding.
Gasless Experience: Through paymasters from the ZKsync codebase, Sophon offers a seamless platform that eliminates transaction fees for end users, significantly enhancing the overall experience.
Entertainment Focus: Rather than competing solely for existing crypto users, Sophon targets entertainment verticals that already have proven traction, including gaming, gambling, sports betting, ticketing, and consumer AI.

About the SOPH Token
The SOPH token serves as the foundation of the Sophon Network, playing essential roles in both current and future operations:
Gas Fee Payments: All transactions on the Sophon Network require gas paid in SOPH. However, thanks to native paymaster technology, end users don't necessarily need to hold SOPH themselves, as transactions can be subsidized by applications or the network.
Network Security: SOPH enables the decentralization of Sophon's sequencer through staking. This mechanism supports the cryptoeconomic security of the network while distributing rewards to participants.
Staking Rewards: Token holders can stake SOPH directly or delegate to Full Nodes (Guardian NFT holders with sufficient delegations). Stakers receive a portion of gas fees and potentially additional ecosystem rewards, with rewards compounding automatically.
Deflationary Model: SOPH staking utilises an inverse square root reward model, inspired by Ethereum, which means that a portion of rewards are unutilised when less than 100% of the total circulating supply is staked. These unutilised rewards are sent to a separate contract where they are either burnt or redistributed as rewards to users. With a portion of unutilized rewards being burned and no ability to mint new tokens, the supply gradually decreases over time.

SOPH Tokenomics
SOPH has a fixed total supply of 10,000,000,000 SOPH tokens. At TGE 2,000,000,000 tokens will be in circulation, with the remainder subject to vesting schedules.

Problems Solved
Avant addresses several key problems in the current financial landscape:

Lack of DeFi-Powered Stable-Value Tokens: Provides a stable-value token that is decentralized, accessible, and offers equal financial opportunities.

Enhanced Yield Potential: Offers users access to high-performing, delta-neutral strategies typically reserved for professional traders, without compromising on security.

Complexity of Manual Strategies: Simplifies access to advanced financial strategies that require extensive expertise and resources.

Better Financial Tools for Users: Delivers improved options for stable-denominated savings and financial management, maximizing capital efficiency for lending and borrowing.","","","yield farming","avalanche","12.1","51.03713348209541","0.0","16.900000000000002","988","0","15.8914","0"

Steem was inspired from the success of Reddit where the community helped enrich the shareholders. Steem aims to help distribute the rewards to the community members who help create the community in the first place. Steem aims to provide various services to its members such as a source of curated news, Q&amp;A, job boards etc. The founders of Steem came from BitShares with Dan Larimer involved as well.

Steem’s main platform, called Steemit, is a social media network built on top of the Steem blockchain. Steemit is similar to popular content-driven social networks like Reddit and Medium, but it rewards users with cryptocurrency for their participation. Fundamentally, the more value a particular piece of content provides to a greater number of people, the more the individuals responsible for creating and curating that content can earn.

Users cast votes, creating a hierarchy of content. The more upvotes a post gets, the more it will earn. The platform also allows for downvotes, giving participants more flexibility when it comes to rating content. Steemit is meritocratic, meaning users that hold more currency can cast votes with greater influence.

The Steemit community even has another service to offer to its customers. D.tube, which is considered to be very similar to YouTube, is Blockchain based and the users can realize the difference between the traditional video publishing websites and D.tube, as the amount of money earned is also displayed beside the post apart from likes shares and comments. The Steemit community is accused of posting plagiarize contents on their publishing website. The irony seems to be reaching highest levels when the original content doesn’t receive much appreciation and income than the copied versions of it.""","2016-03-24","80.0","socialfi","unknown","33.7","45.43509989707584","99.12512362412045","16.900000000000002","1891","3382","63.75649326844215","0"

This is made possible by unique ‘Vault’ architecture that formally defines the requirements of a custom pool and shifts core design patterns out of the pool into a separate ‘singleton contract’. With both internally developed pool types such as Weighted Pools, Boosted Pools, and LVR mitigating stableswaps, and also externally developed pools such as Elliptical Concentrated Liquidity, CoW AMMs, and FxPools, Balancer has arisen to be a focal source of fungible, yield-bearing, and MEV-mitigated liquidity.

In a conventional Liquid ReStaking strategy, the users lock their Liquid Staking Tokens such as stETH into the EigenLayer's Liquid ReStaking Strategy contracts. The cons are that the restaked assets are non-transferrable, non-usable in DeFi, and require 7 days withdrawal period for redemption back into the LSTs. Note that you will need additional delays to redeem ETH from your LSTs, again. 

In ether.fi's eETH and weETH where the Native ReStaking happens in the protocol level:

By holding eETH/weETH, you earn the staking rewards based on the staked ETH amount and protocol's staking yields.

By holding eETH/weETH, you earn the restaking rewards based on the natively restaked ETH in the protocol level and protocol's restaking yields (+ EigenLayer points). Users do not need to make separate actions or lock up their assets.

You can bring your eETH/weETH to another DeFi and do degens!

you can redeem your ETH out of eETH/weETH without the 7 days withdrawal period as long as ether.fi has the available liquid ETH in the contract.","","","liquid restaked eth","swellchain","7.199999999999999","47.15822757858105","0.0","16.900000000000002","1109","0","15.896199999999999","0"

It provides a tokenized service layer that exposes data, storage, compute and algorithms for consumption with a set of deterministic proofs on availability and integrity that serve as verifiable service agreements. There is staking on services to signal quality, reputation and ward against Sybil Attacks.

Ocean helps to unlock data, particularly for AI. It is designed for scale and uses blockchain technology that allows data to be shared and sold in a safe, secure and transparent manner.

The Ocean Protocol is an ecosystem composed of data assets and services, where assets are represented by data and algorithms, and services are represented by integration, processing and persistence mechanisms. Ocean Protocol facilitates discovery by storing and promoting metadata, linking assets and services, and provides a licensing framework that has toolsets for pricing.

A multitude of data marketplaces can hook into Ocean Protocol to provide “last mile” services to connect data providers and consumers. Ocean Protocol is designed so that data owners cannot be locked-in to any single marketplace. The data owner controls each dataset.","","","artificial intelligence (ai)","ethereum","61.1","40.83683682472358","96.3608763656653","61.0","1217","0","60.65125672798285","0"

Web3 provides young individuals – regardless of job position – the ability to become an expert in this growing field without having to climb the decades-long latter to reach a level where you can contribute meaningfully to a company or specific field of work. The smartest people in the world are moving into Web3 – exiting FANG companies – and joining crypto companies or DAOs.

What makes your project unique?
Connex aims to build a permissionless, open, and collaborative Web3 professional network. The CONX token is an essential component to such infrastructures as it functions as the governance token, incentivizes user participation, and serves as the primary payment token of the Connex ecosystem. 
Connex is designed to reward high integrity and proof of fraud. CONX tokens are used to reward the platform users. CONX can be used for rewarding people who upload their CVs with high quality, or reward people who get most viewed and liked. The amount of CONX tokens rewarded will be determined through the voting and governance feature of the platform. People who create circles on Connex and share their valuable views about the circle topics are also welcomed by the platform.

What can your token be used for?
Pay for Subscription
CONX is paid in exchange for subscribing a company or subscribe a SME in the field for talent recruitment and hiring purposes. This would allow them to view and like the CVs uploaded by users of Connex.
Pay for Credential
CONX is paid in exchange for viewing personal on-chain and off-chain credentials of the users. Companies and SMEs may identify their candidates more easily and accurately with the platform’s on-chain and off-chain labels.
Pay for Circle
CONX is used for entering a professional circle, where they may share their valuable views on Circle topics. Users who share their views on Circle will be rewarded with CONX tokens. The amount of CONX tokens rewarded will be determined by tokenholders through the voting and governance feature of the Platform.
Pay for Exposure
CONX is used for a better exposure of a company or people. Companies or SMEs may use their subscription of the Platform for marketing and branding purposes, such as to increase their exposure to users and to build their brands by providing users with details of their respective companies, including their products and services, vision and mission statements, job vacancy descriptions, reasons for joining their respective companies etc.
Governance
CONX is used for voting & governance in Connex DAO, including voting on the fees to be paid by users, companies and SMEs to use the platform, the subscription fee to create and enter the Circle, the use of the tokens in the Community Treasure and the accuracy of a job or CV.
Integrity Assessment
CONX can be staked against any job or credential on the platform to ensure and vouch for the credibility of the job or CVs for an exposure period. If the credibility of the job or CV is not challenged, then the tokenholder who staked the CONX tokens will be rewarded with more CONX tokens. However, if the credibility of the job or CV is challenged and the information therein is proved to be inaccurate, then the staked token will be burnt. The determination of the accuracy of the job or CV is conducted on-chain through the voting and governance feature of the Platform. While there may be plans to reward successful challengers of such job or CVs, and earn CONX tokens for such participation, this is in the process of being established and is currently not a feature of the platform. For the avoidance of doubt, the CONX tokens do not confer upon tokenholders any right to rewards by virtue of their holding of the CONX tokens only, but is a right to vouch for the credibility of a specific job or credentials on the platform on staking of the CONX tokens which, in turn, grants right to rewards on determination of the credibility of such job or credentials based on the exercise of voting rights and participation in platform governance by the tokenholders after their staking of the CONX tokens.
Community Treasure
20% of the total supply of the token will be distributed to the Community Treasure, which is intended to be used to reward users who boost the platform’s growth and usage. For example, users will be rewarded when they recommend their friends, who have the capability and who are willing to work in the Web3 industry, to use the platform. Users who suggest new platform features to boost platform usage and smoothen the integration between the platform and other major talent hiring sites will also be rewarded. The amount of CONX tokens rewarded or decision on whether to adopt the new platform features will be determined by tokenholders through the voting and governance feature of the platform.

The Fund primarily invests its total assets in cash, U.S. Treasury bills, and repurchase agreements, allowing investors to earn yield while holding the token on the blockchain. 
 
The Fund pursues its investment objective by investing only in cash, U.S. Treasury obligations, which include securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury where the payment of principal and interest is backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government (“U.S. Treasury Obligations”), and repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Treasury Obligations and cash. The Fund will invest in securities with maturities of (or deemed maturities of) 397 days or less and will maintain a dollar-weighted average portfolio maturity of 60 days or less and a dollar-weighted average portfolio life of 120 days or less. 

The Fund may also invest in one or more other pooled investment vehicles managed by third-party investment managers or the Investment Manager or an affiliate thereof that invest in the same types of securities in which the Fund may invest directly (“Underlying Funds”). Underlying Funds may include investment companies registered under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”).

The Fund may also invest in or otherwise hold one or more stablecoins and similar yield-bearing digital asset instruments, including in connection with investors that subscribe for Shares (as defined below) in-kind with stablecoins and such instruments instead of U.S. dollars, including subscriptions executed through Atomic Swaps (as defined below), and in connection with processing redemption transactions.

For the purposes of satisfying the Fund’s investment strategy of investing only in cash, U.S. Treasury Obligations and repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Treasury Obligations and cash, investments in Underlying Funds, stablecoins and similar yieldbearing digital asset instruments will be considered as if they are invested in cash and such securities.

For the purposes of this Memorandum, the Fund’s investments are collectively referred to as “Investments”. While the Fund intends to invest in the manner described above, the Fund will also remain opportunistic and may pursue other investment opportunities.

There can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective; you could lose money by investing in the Fund. Although the Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per Share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the Fund is not a bank account or a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. You should not expect that the Investment Manager or its affiliates will provide financial support to the Fund at any time, including during periods of market stress.","","","bnb chain ecosystem","ethereum","0.3","50.0","0.0","16.900000000000002","3018","0","15.921550000000002","0"

This cryptocurrency is the brainchild of Peter Waterland who realised that Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other such cryptocurrencies have no protection against future technology. It claims to be a “future-proof” cryptocurrency which enables transactions and decentralized communication while providing protection against classical as well as quantum computer attacks.

The Quantum Resistant Ledger company was founded by Peter Waterland, who found that Bitcoin, as well as Ethereum signatures are susceptible to attacks by powerful quantum computers. His research on quantum computers and signature programs let to the development of this new cryptocurrency, designed to be resistant to the present classical attacks as well as any future quantum computer attacks. Their team is made up of a diverse range of members spread out across the world, including developers (core, blockchain, mobile developers, etc.), analysts, advisors, marketing managers, designers and more.

Quantum Resistant Ledger is the first ever cryptocurrency and the only one in existence as of August 2018, to consider the threat that the future technology of quantum computing poses to cryptocurrencies and their working. It uses a technology specifically designed for post-quantum security, called XMSS, which makes it secure against powerful quantum computers even while using a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. Security against cyber-attacks is a very serious concern in this digital age, especially when you have digital assets whose loss is likely to lead you to bankruptcy.

QRL is the first blockchain technology that provides durability and stability through resistance to quantum computer attacks. The encryption methods used by modern blockchains can become vulnerable to quantum computers over the next ten years. QRL tries to create a blockchain with long-term stability. By using blockchain technology, the QRL platform creates a “ledger” that generates hashes in such a way that it is virtually impenetrable to any type of computer attack.","2018-06-26","100.0","smart contract platform","unknown","49.1","56.77117627518139","96.91614427398098","49.9","2172","2558","69.88800049589334","0"

Decentralized finance has massive potential, but several challenges have consistently held it back from broader adoption:
-Complex User Experience: The steep learning curve, confusing interfaces, and technical barriers make DeFi intimidating for newcomers.
-Fragmented Ecosystem: Managing assets across multiple blockchains can feel disjointed and labor-intensive, with users needing to navigate different platforms and tools.
-Risk of User Errors: DeFi can be unforgiving—losing a seed phrase or making a small mistake can lead to significant financial losses.
-Issues with Centralized Exchanges: Centralized exchanges compromise control and security by holding custody of users' assets, which goes against the core principles of decentralization.

Defi App directly addresses these issues to make DeFi simple, safe, and accessible:
-Unified Platform: Defi App provides native account abstraction, allowing you to connect your wallets and manage all your assets without dealing with technical intricacies. There’s no need to navigate multiple tools or migrate assets across chains—everything you need is in one place.
-Cross-Chain Capabilities: Our platform supports seamless engagement across different blockchain networks. Swap tokens, leverage assets, or yield farm—Defi App breaks down chain boundaries, so you can take advantage of opportunities anywhere in DeFi.
-Gasless Transactions: Defi App sponsors gas fees, meaning you don’t need to hold specific gas tokens for every chain. This makes transactions easy and eliminates a common barrier that frustrates both new and experienced users.
-Intuitive Design: Defi App’s user-friendly interface ensures that anyone, from beginners to experts, can navigate DeFi confidently.

t is used as an incentive to correctly decentralize the Tokamak Plasma Chain. The service operator must deposit TON to open the Plasma Chain. If the chain properly runs, this deposit will gradually increase. However, if there is a technical issue in the chain and someone who finds problem raises an issue, and then, the deposit as a reward will go to that person (challenger).

Moreover, TON is also used to charge Stamina, which is the transaction fee in Plasma Chain. The stamina will be recharged after a certain period.

Kyber Network is a hub of liquidity protocols that aggregates liquidity from various sources to provide secure and instant transactions on any decentralized application (DApp). The main goal of Kyber Network is to enable DeFi DApps, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and other users easy access to liquidity pools that provide the best rates.

All transactions on Kyber are on-chain, which means they can be easily verified using any Ethereum block explorer. Projects can build on top of Kyber to utilize all the services offered by the protocol, such as the instant settlement of tokens, liquidity aggregation, and a customizable business model.

Kyber looks to solve the liquidity issue in the decentralized finance (DeFi) industry by allowing developers to build products and services without having to worry about liquidity for different needs. 

The Kyber Network Crystal (KNC) token is a utility token that is the ""glue that connects different stakeholders in Kyber's ecosystem."" KNC holders can stake their tokens in the KyberDAO to help govern the platform and vote on important proposals — and earn staking rewards in Ethereum (ETH) that come from trading fees. 

What Makes Kyber Network Unique?
Kyber Network is the first tool that allows anyone to instantly swap tokens without the need of a third-party, like a centralized exchange. The unique architecture of Kyber is designed to be developer-friendly, which enables the protocol to be easily integrated with apps and other blockchain-based protocols.

DeFi has many use cases and possibilities. Therefore, no single liquidity protocol can fit the needs of all liquidity providers, takers, and other market participants. Kyber’s liquidity hub architecture allows developers and the Kyber team to rapidly innovate and integrate new protocols into the overall Kyber Network to cater to different liquidity needs.

In April 2021, Kyber launched the Kyber DMM, the world’s first dynamic market maker protocol (DMM). Kyber DMM is a next-generation AMM designed to react to market conditions to optimise fees, maximise earnings, and enable extremely high capital efficiency for liquidity providers, especially for stable pairs with low variability in price range (like USDC/USDT, ETH/SETH). They will be able to support pools with extremely high amplification factors, which means given the same liquidity pool and trade size, slippage can be 100x (or more) better than typical AMMs. Depending on their amplification strategy, liquidity providers can maximise the use of their capital and have the opportunity to earn much more fees relative to their contribution size, while takers can enjoy extremely low slippage on their trades.

Kyber DMM is the first of many new liquidity protocols that will be launched on the Kyber 3.0 Liquidity Hub.

In the Kyber ecosystem, KNC token holders play an important role in deciding new growth and value-capture opportunities and incentive mechanisms. Through KyberDAO, KNC holders can participate in the governance of the network by voting on important proposals. Kyber’s community is sizable and made up of a wide range of developers, in addition to other members of the blossoming DeFi industry.

Kyber’s fully on-chain design enables the protocol to maintain full transparency and verifiability. The platform claims to be the most used liquidity hub in the world.

How Is the Kyber Network Secured?
As an ERC-20 token, Kyber is built on top of and secured by the Ethereum blockchain. In addition, Kyber uses an extensive trust and security model that protects users from misbehaving administrators or exchanges, thanks to security measures built in both at the protocol and smart contract level.

The platform has been audited by several third-party security firms and researchers, including Chainsecurity, which have determined that the protocol is secure and hence free of vulnerabilities.","","","decentralized exchange (dex)","ethereum","85.0","41.495299504330376","97.54409686384726","77.2","3942","0","65.13848390234654","0"

Neutron is the most secure cross-chain smart-contracting platform. It combines the security of a top 10 blockchain by staked capitalization with bleeding-edge cross-chain infrastructure to enable DeFi applications to securely scale across a growing network of 51+ interconnected blockchains.

What makes your project unique?
Neutron is a permissionless smart-contract platform built with Tendermint and the Cosmos SDK. It makes development of secure cross-chain applications easier and more profitable. Through Interchain Security, Neutron provides developers with the full Proof-of-Stake security of the Cosmos Hub, one of the ten most secure blockchains in existence, at a fraction of the cost of running an appchain. Smart-contracts on Neutron can be written in Rust and run on CosmWasm, which protects them from the main attack vectors used against Solidity/EVM dApps. Neutron provides convenient interfaces that smart-contracts can use to execute and track transactions on remote blockchains, trigger callbacks and retrieve data trustlessly over IBC.

Cartesi is an application-specific rollups execution layer with a Linux runtime. Cartesi’s RISC-V virtual machine allows developers to import decades of open-source wisdom to blockchain applications and build decentralized applications with their favorite libraries, compilers, and other time-tested open-source tooling. Cartesi Rollups can be deployed as layer 2 (on top of Ethereum) or as layer 3 (on top of Optimism, Arbitrum, zkEVM chains, etc.), or as sovereign rollups.

What Makes Cartesi Unique and Key Highlights
Cartesi is an application-specific rollup execution layer with a Linux runtime. Cartesi’s RISC-V virtual machine allows developers to import decades of open-source wisdom to blockchain applications and build decentralized applications with their favorite libraries, compilers, and other time-tested open-source tooling.

DApps are deployed on their own customizable application-specific rollup chains;
DApps don't compete with each other in Cartesi’s ecosystem for scarce blockspace;
Provides Ethereum or L2’s with orders of magnitude more computational capacity;
Developers can code decentralized logic with their favorite libraries, compilers and other time-tested open source components;
DApps preserve the strong security guarantees and censorship resistance of the underlying blockchain;
Cartesi Rollups can be deployed as a layer 2 (on top of Ethereum), as a layer 3 (on top of Optimism, Arbitrum, zkEVM chains, etc.), or as sovereign rollups;
Cartesi Rollups opens up the design space for more expressive and computationally intensive blockchain applications.
The Cartesi Team
The most important asset for The Cartesi Foundation is an ecosystem of contributors, each with a team of strong professionals, researchers and engineers extremely excited to create and implement cutting edge solutions in the blockchain space. 

Cartesi’s core contributors come from high profile backgrounds with real-world experience at top companies such as Microsoft Research, and PhDs from top universities like ETH Zurich and Princeton.

To read about the Cartesi Foundation's story and see the full lineup of contributors, visit the About page.

What Can CTSI Be Used For? 
The token for Cartesi, CTSI, has been designed to intermediate protocol governance and to provide additional convenience and timeliness to Cartesi DApps. 

CTSI’s primary function is governance for the Cartesi ecosystem.

Cartesi Foundation's decentralized ecosystem will use CTSI as a way for community members to signal approval or disapproval of community programs originating from Cartesi Improvement Proposals (CIPs).
The first will be to govern the Cartesi Community Grant Program and ecosystem. The community grant program will fund new DApps built on Cartesi Rollups, public goods or retroactively fund successful projects in the Cartesi ecosystem.
As the Cartesi Foundation becomes more and more decentralized, CTSI will be used in several aspects of governing the future ecosystem, network, and DAOs.
​​​​CTSI will also play an increasingly important role in terms of convenience and timeliness for DApps through Noether. Noether is a proof-of-stake solution for race-condition problems in financially incentivized blockchain interactions. In other words, node runners and stakers participating in Nother are financially rewarded for timely executing future Cartesi Ecosystem services, such as the decentralized sequencer, automatic execution vouchers, liquidity providers, and validator claims. 

Noether also plays a role in Cartesi's governance. CTSI holders willing to participate in governance voting must first have their tokens delegated to a pool in the PoS system.

TruFin’s second product, TruStake Aptos, is an Aptos staking vault which provides access to APT liquid staking on the Aptos network. TruAPT is the liquid staking token users receive when they deposit APT into the TruStake vault. It is fungible asset standard like APT and has all the same basic functionality. As soon as a user deposits APT on the TruStake smart contract, they receive newly minted TruAPT, based on the exchange rate at the time of staking. As APT staking rewards accrue, the value of TruAPT increases (with reference to APT).

- Users have have the ability to stake their APT through TruFin’s [dApp](https://app.trufin.io/).
- When a user stakes with TruFin, they will mint a new liquid token — TruAPT.
- Rewards are restaked automatically, giving an uplift in APY from the compounding effect.","","","decentralized finance (defi)","aptos","2.8000000000000003","50.27020826347308","0.0","16.900000000000002","1026","0","15.892225000000002","0"

However, many blockchains cannot handle so many Transactions, and nodes often crash.
Oasys, as a game-specific blockchain, uses technology that is less likely to fail due to the increased number of transactions caused by games.

Oasys is a multi-layered EVM-compatible PoS public blockchain that solves game developers’ struggles with other blockchains.

The main competitors are blockchains trying to solve the problems of scalability, gas fees, and transaction speed of Ethereum. e.g) Flow, Avalanche, Polygon, Polkadot and so on. 

For gamers
1. Zero Gas Fees
2. High-speed Transactions
3. Scam Less

For game developers.
1. Flexible Token Design with using vTokens and oTokens
2. Builders’ Own Verse
3. EVM-Compatible
4. Scam Resistance


For IP holders
1. Easier to Protect IP
2. Eco Friendly
3. A verse limited to own IP
4. Scam Resistance

And features of Oasys are three points as below.
Firstly, Hub-Layer :  High Scalability, High Data Availability, High Network Stability.

The Hub-Layer is specialized for storing and exchanging data securely and in a stable manner, so it does not allow applications to run directly. The layer maintains high data availability as all data on Oasys is stored. Block time is set to every 15 seconds , the same level as Ethereum, to ensure stable data transmission to globally distributed nodes. With the same level of network stability as Ethereum, the Hub-Layer has enough resilience to operate with thousands of Verse-Layers connected.

Secondly, Verse-Layer: Oasys Layer-2 Technology.

The Verse-Layer is the layer 2 blockchain on Oasys. The layer can operate as a permissioned chain. While there are several layer 2 options, our solution is customized Optimistic rollups at this moment.

Finally, Token Design: Three Types of FT/NFT.

Fungible Token (FT) and Non-Fungible Token (NFT) are essential assets for tokenomics in the ecosystem. ","","","smart contract platform","unknown","13.3","41.42990384865503","0.0","16.900000000000002","1984","0","15.914800000000001","0"

As originators of the iNFT standard, Alethea AI is on the cutting edge of embedding AI animation, interaction and generative AI capabilities into NFTs. Developers can use the iNFT protocol to Create, Train and Earn from their iNFTs in the world’s first Intelligent Metaverse known as Noah’s Ark.
Noah's Ark has a bold aim: To preserve and evolve the culture, stories and collective intelligence of the human species.

The NFT ecosystem is witnessing a Cambrian explosion in innovation and creativity, with avatar-centric communities launching at a scale and speed we never thought possible. New intellectual property is being created from the bottom-up, without the involvement of major corporate studios or large budgets. 
Creators and communities will soon demand to do more with their NFTs, and the Alethea AI team sees the Noah’s Ark Intelligent Metaverse as the connective tissue for the numerous  NFT projects and owners to bond and create rich, free-flowing, enjoyable interactive experiences on a crypto-native stack.

As the population of iNFTs within the Noah’s Ark increases, so too will the possibilities of interactions and collaborations with and between these iNFTs - enabling the emergence of an """"Intelligent Hive Mind"""", powering the Ark's AI Engine. This intelligence will enable us to not only explore what it means to be human and what constitutes a personality, but also to discover how an Intelligent Metaverse powered by such an Intelligence can help shape our stories, culture, and intelligence as we realize the true meaning behind being Homo Narrans.","","100.0","artificial intelligence (ai)","ethereum","47.699999999999996","49.433711827434074","0.0","63.6","1721","0","27.585600000000003","0"

It offers a composable stack for building these services and a protocol for incentivizing their creation. Autonolas uniquely enables the operation of these services in a co-owned and decentralized manner.

Autonolas services are ideal for combining crypto and AI, executing complex logic in a decentralized manner, and interacting with on- and off-chain data autonomously and continuously. A novel use case of this cutting-edge autonomous agent technology is Governatooorr, an AI-enabled governance delegate for DAOs.

Autonolas DAO was established in the summer of 2022, and the public token launch took place via a liquidity bootstrapping pool in July 2023.

Autonolas is on a healthy growth trajectory and is regularly adding support for additional chains. The project's goal is to be deployed on every major blockchain, powering their core off-chain services and realizing the vision of a unified network of off-chain services.

The OLAS token provides access to the network's core functions. Users can stake OLAS to operate off-chain services and lock OLAS in veOLAS to gain governance rights, thereby contributing to the shaping of the network. Furthermore, OLAS powers a unique system of developer incentives aimed at expanding the number of services in the Olas ecosystem. Governance members can boost ETH donations to desirable services, made up of autonomous agents and their software components and referred to as  'useful code', with OLAS from the protocol. Existing token holders can bond LP shares involving OLAS into the protocol to increase protocol-owned liquidity, known as 'useful capital'. For more information, visit the DAO’s website at https://olas.network.","","100.0","artificial intelligence (ai)","ethereum","7.5","45.66624601357215","0.0","16.900000000000002","1808","0","15.91225","0"

One of the goals of QuarkChain is to utilize sharding technology to deliver over 1 million transactions per second (tps). Essentially, QuarkChain markets itself as a peer-to-peer blockchain with a high capacity throughput to help deliver fast and secure decentralized applications. The team behind QuarkChain created this blockchain to resolve the issue of scalability that all the major blockchains are currently facing. The team feels that because of the urgency of this issue, the Bitcoin community simply cannot afford to wait until they all agree on a solution. Instead, they feel that by offering different solutions, such as the one inherent in QuarkChain, this compels the community to split via a hard fork and find the solution that works best.

QuarkChain encourages increased decentralization through multiple cheap nodes that then create a cluster that works as a super-full node. This prevents the high expenses associated with super-full nodes when the tps gets high. In terms of protection, all transactions within QuarkChain get the protection of 50 percent of the network’s hash power. This makes a double-spending attack incredibly challenging, particularly when combined with QuarkChain’s decentralized nature.

QuarkChain relies on a two-layer blockchain structure. Sharding blockchains known as shards are the first layer, while the second layer is a root blockchain that confirms the shards’ blocks.The major work on QuarkChain began in Q2 2017 with research into the problem of blockchain scalability. In Q4 of that year, the team drafted the whitepaper. In February 2018, it released the white paper and completed verification code 0.1. March 2018 saw the 0.1 versions of both the wallet and testnet. Now in Q2, the team is working on the testnet 1.0 and smart contract 0.1. In Q4 2018, the team will have the QuarkChain Core 1.0, along with the mainnet 1.0 and the SmartWallet 1.0. By Q2 2019, both the SmartWallet and QuarkChain Core will be in their 2.0 versions.

QuarkChain is a decentralized blockchain network that aims to resolve the issues of scalability that plague existing networks by using sharding technology. In this way, QuarkChain can dramatically extend the usefulness of blockchain technology since many applications are limited by the scalability of existing blockchain networks. The project is still in progress, but QuarkChain has already made many positive steps and already began invite-based beta testing for the testnet, showing significant progress and potential.

The main features of Quarkchain are:

1. Reshardable two-layered blockchain: Quarkchain consists of two layers of blockchains. We apply elastic sharding blockchains (shards) as the first layer, and a root blockchain as the second layer that confirms the blocks from the first layer. The second layer that confirms the blocks from the first layer. The second layer is flexible to be resharded as needed without changing the root layer.

2. Guaranteed security by market-driven collaborative mining: To ensure the security of all transactions, a game-theoretic framework is designed for incentives, where at least 50% of overall hash powers are allocated to the root chain to prevent double spending attack on any transactions.

3. Anti-centralized horizontal scalability: In any blockchain network with a high TPS, a super-full node can be extremely expensive, which encourages centralization. In contrast, QuarkChain allows multiple cheap nodes forming a cluster to replace a super-full node.

4. Efficient cross-shard transactions: Cross-shard transactions in QuarkChain can be issued at any time, and confirmed in minutes. The speed of cross-shard transactions increases linearly as the number of shards increases.

5. Simple account management: There is only one account needed for the entire blockchain (shards) in QuarkChain.

A primary example is a letter of credit (LOC), analogous to a paper bank cheque drawing verified funds, providing an economic guarantee of payment.

Anvil enables transparency and trustless verification of assets, thereby reducing counterparty risk. The protocol is designed for maximum efficiency and extensibility to incorporate collateral throughout decentralized and traditional finance. 

What can Anvil be used for?
Anvil is a unified protocol for asset provision, designed explicitly for safety, simplicity, and composability as a primitive building block in the development of other applications. 

Payments: LOCs offer security for both online and in-store digital payment transactions.

Counterparty credit: LOCs can be accepted on centralized exchanges to secure instant deposits for immediate trading or more efficient liquidity provision.

Asset bridging: LOCs can facilitate immediate cross-platform transactions. LOCs can also secure deposit or withdrawal transactions on layer 2 (L2) implementations. In instances where a platform integrates Anvil LOCs, immediate, on-demand asset transfers can be safely executed.","","","decentralized finance (defi)","ethereum","5.8999999999999995","45.23741688558416","0.0","16.900000000000002","1250","0","15.901000000000002","0"

CorgiAI is a community driven AI project centered around the creation of a tight knitted community. In CorgiAI, we would like to combine the best of AI with web3 capabilities and allow users to explore the limitless potential of AI technology. 


What makes your project unique?
We are the first project on Cronos Chain to build with AI technology. We have ambitious plans to launch various features with the aid of AI Image Generative Tool and Chatbots so that our users can try out these tools while having fun and earning yields on our platform. 


History of your project.
Our project was officially launched in Jun 2023 along with the ICO of our native token via VVS Finance. We are currently incubated in Cronos Labs Accelerator Program.


What’s next for your project?
We are in preparation to launch several features to expand the utility of $CORGIAI and to allow users exploring AI image generation technology.

What can your token be used for?
Currently, it is equipped with staking capability. However, in a near feature, it will be used for a wide range of features on our platform such as redeeming credits for generating images with AI.

To further strengthen its economic structure, BC.GAME employs a weekly buyback and burn mechanism. A portion of the platform's revenue or reserves is allocated to buy $BC tokens from exchanges or liquidity pools, guided by market conditions, token performance, or strategic objectives. These tokens are then permanently removed from circulation through an automated or manual burn process, executed via smart contracts.

QANplatform, the quantum-resistant hybrid blockchain platform enables developers and enterprises to rapidly build software applications like DApps or DeFi and run business processes on blockchain. A blockchain platform, like QANplatform is the basic infrastructure of all blockchain projects and applications. It is like the operating system on a computer. The whole ecosystem can only build and work on top of it. Connect it with real-world data, run automated smart contracts, build decentralized applications (DApps). According to HFS Research excerpt for IBM: Enterprise blockchain adoption is going through a “90-9-1” adoption challenge. 90% of companies are still trying to internalize the concept and its relevant impact. 9% of enterprises that identified relevant use cases are struggling to start with their PoCs and pilots. The 1% of enterprises that have successful pilots are challenged with scalability to a production-grade environment. To achieve blockchain mass adoption Qanplatform focused on these challenges. They built a lot of automation and integration to help freelance developers, blockchain development companies and enterprises start their blockchain PoCs (Proof-of-Concept) as fast as possible. It takes less than 5 minutes to deploy the QAN private blockchain to a preferred cloud platform and start building on it. 

Who Are the Founders of QANplatform ? 

Johann Polecsak, QAN's Chief Technology Officer is also an economist. He along with the Business Development team pursues the way to make QAN as appealing as possible. In the end all what matters is market share. His laser focus lights in the single direction of eliminating any obstacles which could come up as a reason not to implement Blockchain technology, making QAN the only sane choice to work with. Endre Abraham (Silur), QAN's Head of Cryptology contributed to several blockchain projects like Ethereum, Zcash, or Monero. Gaining such an extensive experience could only lead him in one direction: Building a blockchain which solves the pain points of the existing mainstream ones.

What Makes QANplatform Unique? 

QANplatform solves the problems enterprises and developers face when using currently available blockchain by building a platform from scratch that does not require them to make compromises:

    - Hybrid blockchain platform
    - 80% faster implementation than other blockchains
    - Lowest hardware and energy requirements on the market
    - Predictable data transaction prices for public blockchains
    - Enterprise-ready transaction speed
    - Quantum-resistant security 

The experienced team behind QANplatform worked in companies and projects like IBM, Telekom, Uber, Bitcoin.com, Ethereum, Monero, Zcash...","","40.0","smart contract platform","ethereum","63.4","45.59252851760443","79.96264559348998","86.9","2776","0","61.407725957721496","0"

Developed by the DODO team, Proactive Market Maker (PMM) is an oracle-aided algorithm with an advanced pricing formula that provides contract-fillable liquidity. Traders get lower slippage with PMM than Automated Market Maker (AMM).

PMM leverages price oracles to retrieve accurate market prices of assets as input. It then aims to provide sufficient liquidity near the market price for every asset. The result is that liquidity decreases rapidly when far away from the market price. The following graphs compare the price curves of DODO (PMM) and Uniswap (AMM).","","","decentralized exchange (dex)","ethereum","60.3","40.64125567320872","0.0","85.7","653","0","33.06965","0"

uniETH represents the staked ETH in Bedrock plus all future staking rewards. uniETH is non-rebasing, i.e. does not grow in quantity over time but grows in value instead. In other words, 1 uniETH will be worth more than 1 ETH as time goes on, and its value will continue to increase as more time passes.

Launched by RockX, Bedrock is a non-custodial solution that satisfies the requirements of institutions seeking a basis for large-scale liquid staking. By bringing new levels of transparency and security to liquid staking, Bedrock allows institutions to unlock liquidity safely by adhering to regulations while leveraging a true crypto-native solution.

The AVA token functions as the key to accessing web3 loyalty programs and provides perks to end users, such as AVA payment discounts, AVA loyalty rewards, gated access benefits, and more. Launched in 2017, the AVA Foundation says their overarching mission is to create a decentralised and self-sufficient blockchain-based loyalty ecosystem with AVA at its core. What’s next for your project? AVA is a web3 loyalty program token designed for projects across all industries. From discounts to loyalty rewards, AVA powers blockchain-based loyalty programs via a plug-and-play approach. What can your token be used for? Travel Bookings: AVA can be used to book more than 3 million travel products on Travala, including hotels, homes, flights, and activities in over 230 countries. Discounts & Rewards: Travel bookings paid with AVA receive a discount of up to 3% on the total booking price, as well as a cashback of up to 2% in AVA. Loyalty Program: AVA unlocks further benefits via the Smart Loyalty Program, which provides users with discounts of up to 10% on travel bookings. Travel NFTs: AVA paired with Travel Tiger NFTs unlocks the Diamond membership, with exclusive benefits such as Travel Credits, Airport Lounges, VIP Concierge, and Travel Drops (unique travel experience giveaways). Open Passport: With AVA, users can access the Open Passport to collect digital NFT stamps for every travel booking. Each NFT serves as “proof of travel” and, in the future, will unlock rewards and discounts. Voting: AVA grants voting rights to users based on their Smart loyalty membership level to have a say on how funds in the AVA Community Pool are spent. Payments: AVA use cases extend to other platforms, allowing users to shop and spend with AVA at millions of merchants via Binance Pay and Simplex or pay bills. Governance: As the AVA ecosystem becomes more decentralised, AVA will be the governance token needed to vote for future changes and improvements to the ecosystem. AVA Deals: Travala will launch a new travel offer initiative named “AVA Deals”, with thousands of travel products at heavily discounted prices (up to 70% off) bookable exclusively with AVA.","","100.0","tourism","ethereum","57.3","42.993663816479675","0.0","80.2","2278","0","31.743025000000003","0"

Origin’s products are built to be permissionless and composable, allowing for deep integration with novel primitives. All of Origin’s products streamline rewards to OGN stakers, cultivating a sustainable, user-first offering.

OGN is the governance and value-accrual token for Origin’s sprawling yield ecosystem. Users can stake OGN for xOGN, which carries voting and economic power across Origin’s product suite.

Staking model: OGN can be locked on a time horizon of 1 month – 1 year. Users who stake OGN receive xOGN relative to the amount staked and the duration of the lock-up period. xOGN grants holders economic and voting rights during the staking period.

Rewards: Origin takes a performance fee from its yield generating products. Half of this fee is distributed to OGN stakers in the form of extra rewards, while the remaining 50% funds the purchase of flywheel tokens to boost yield generated by the underlying protocols.

Governance: OGN stakers comprise the Origin DAO, which votes on proposals and treasury allocations. Origin promotes fully on-chain governance to cultivate a sustainable, inclusive structure.","","","nft","ethereum","88.4","43.71653969978673","97.83655219631751","91.0","1308","0","68.67074326871113","0"

The Huobi Token (HT) rewards exchange users for their loyalty with lowered transaction fees while also carrying its own value in tradable pairs against popular currencies. The hope was to bring greater value to Huobi’s millions of users, mostly located in Asian countries. The launch of the Huobi Token follows in the footsteps of other loyalty-building tokens that other exchanges have launched. The first and most successful of these tokens has been Binance Coin (BNB). The creation of BNB secured Binance’s place as the world’s leading exchange. It offered discounted trading fees in exchange for customer loyalty, primarily functioning as a loyalty rewards system.

Huobi officially announced its intentions to launch a new token on January 22, 2018. Over the course of 15 days, Huobi would distribute 300 million HT (60% of the total supply) to its pro users who purchased a discounted service package. Each morning, a new batch of HT would become available on a first come, first served basis. Huobi declared this token distribution scheme, “not an ICO,” due to the nature of the offering. Users are buying a specific service package, part of which includes HT that give a discount toward trading fees. The exchange launched the Huobi Token as part of an overall strategy to recover its user base after tightening regulations in China severely restricted cryptocurrency trading. In an interview with CoinDesk, Leon Li, Huobi’s founder, revealed that Chinese rule changes had decimated the trading volume on Huobi by 95% between September 15 and November 1, 2017.

The HT token distribution began on January 24 and wrapped up on February 7, 2018. Each day of the distribution, millions of tokens sold out in mere minutes after going on sale. At that point, 300 million HT had been distributed to Huobi Pro members who bought packages. That’s 60% of the total supply currently in public circulation. Another 200 million HT, 40% of the total supply, was set aside. 20% goes toward user rewards and platform operation. The other 20% is vested for four years and constitutes the team reward.

Huobi isn’t the first exchange to issue its own token. Binance (BNB), Bibox (BIX), KuCoin (KCS) and Coss (COSS) have all issued their own tokens as well.","2018-01-31","","exchange-based tokens","ethereum","38.5","47.85750064167481","0.0","63.3","2364","2704","39.443850000000005","0"

It is an Ethereum ERC20 token that is pegged to $1 USD — every Dai is worth $1, and will always be worth $1, regardless of how much Dai is in existence. There is no centralized authority like Tether that backs its value, and no traditional bank that backs each Dai with a real US dollar. There is nothing that can be shut down, and no centralized authority that needs to be trusted. Dai lives entirely within the Ethereum blockchain using smart contracts.

*Features of Dai:
1. Dai is always worth $1 USD each
2. It can be freely traded like any other ERC20 token
3. Anyone with an Ethereum wallet can own, accept, and transfer it
4. It can be exchanged without any middleman
5. No individual person or company has control over it
6. No government or authority can shut it down

*How Dai Works?
Dai is a masterpiece of game theory that carefully balances economic incentives in the pursuit of one goal — a token that is continuously approaching the value of $1 USD.

When Dai is worth above $1, mechanisms work to decrease the price. When Dai is worth below $1, mechanisms work to increase the price. The rational actors that take part in these mechanisms do so because they earn money anytime Dai is not perfectly worth $1. This is why Dai is always floating slightly above or below $1 — it is an endless wave function bouncing infinitely close to $1, but never quite achieving it. The farther Dai goes from $1, the more incentive there is to fix it. This is the magic of Dai.

*How is Dai Created?
Dai is simply a loan against Ethereum. By using the MakerDAO dApp, advanced users can take loans out in Dai against their ETH holdings.

First, ETH is turned into “wrapped ETH” (WETH), which is simply an ERC20 wrapping around ETH. This “tokenizes” ETH so it can be used like any other ERC20 token. Next, WETH is turned into “pooled ETH” (PETH), which means it joins a large pool of Ethereum that is the collateral for all Dai created. Once you have PETH, you can create a “collateralized debt position” (CDP), which locks up your PETH and allows you to draw Dai against your collateral, which is PETH. As you draw out Dai, the ratio of debt in the CDP increases. There is a debt limit that sets a maximum amount of Dai you can draw against your CDP. Once you have Dai, you can spend or trade it freely like any other ERC20 token.

*There are several important reasons why you would create Dai, despite the hassle:

1. You need a loan, and have an asset (ETH) to use as collateral for your loan

2. You believe ETH is going up in value. You can use your CDP to buy ETH on margin — you lock up your ETH in a CDP, draw Dai against it, use the Dai to buy more ETH on an exchange, and then use that ETH to further increase the size of your CDP. This can be accomplished without any third-party or centralized authority allowing you to do so — margin trading can be accomplished entirely on the blockchain.

3. The demand for Dai has driven the price above $1 USD. When this occurs, you can create Dai then immediately sell it on an exchange for greater than $1 USD. This is essentially free money, and is one of the mechanisms the Maker system uses to keep Dai pegged to $1 USD. Dai being worth over $1 USD encourages more Dai to be created.
These three reasons are enough to ensure that Dai is continually created.","2017-12-18","","decentralized finance (defi)","ethereum","3.8","47.5687357248288","97.2144947330243","16.900000000000002","3358","2748","62.0970731565585","0"

Instead of maintaining its own data centres, Storj platform relies on a peer-to-peer network of individuals or entities sharing their storage spaces. The Storj project is owned and developed by Storj Labs Inc. Storj intends to facilitate a faster, cheaper, and secure file storage solution than traditional cloud storage platforms. To achieve its goal, Storj deploys several innovative technologies and methods to make sure that users are able to store and retrieve data in a fastest possible way while not compromising the security and integrity of data.

Storj Labs Inc was founded in 2014 by Shawn Wilkinson with co-founders John Quinn. The company is headquartered at Atlanta, Georgia in the United States. Shawn was previously appointed as CEO, but in March 2018, he stepped down from the post to serve as CSO of the company.

Shawn was replaced by Ben Golub (Ex-CEO of Docker) who currently serves as the Executive Chairman &amp; Interim CEO. Co-founder John Quinn has been appointed as the Chief Revenue Officer. The company launched its initial coin offering (ICO) of the new tokens on May 19, 2017. At the end of the token sale on May 25, 2017, the company had raised about $30 million. Storj Labs allowed SJCX holders to exchange their tokens with the new ones in a 1:1 ratio through a token conversion campaign which lasted till October 2017.

Storj Labs pre-mined its entire supply of tokens at the inception; no new tokens can be created via STORJ mining. Nevertheless, users can obtain STORJ tokens by becoming a farmer in the network. Another obvious way to acquire STORJ is through trading on a cryptocurrency exchange. Up until now, cloud storage companies have dictated the terms of service to their users, and as a result, there has been little to no competition within this digital sector. However, with the introduction of Storj, all of that may change.""

The company was founded in 2017 in Silicon Valley by Chris Wang and top researchers and engineers in the field. 

With a breakthrough consensus protocol that overcomes the scalability “trilemma” called PaLa, the ThunderCore network offers 4,000+ TPS, sub-second confirmation times, and low gas fees that cost less than a fraction of a dollar ( < $0.00001), giving decentralized applications security and scalability. 

Evidently, ThunderCore DApps have been dominating the gaming and gambling category charts week after week, a true testament to how easy it is for DApps to scale on the platform.

ThunderCore also prioritizes interoperability, as native assets on other blockchains (eg. Ethereum, BSC, HECO) can be exchanged amongst each other through a cross-chain mechanism called ThunderCore Bridge. 

By solving usability challenges and setting a new standard of reliability and security, ThunderCore leads the effort to bring wide adoption to blockchain technology.

Currently, with an international user base that spans across more than 18 countries, ThunderCore has amassed more than 4 million total addresses and 180 million transactions on its network.","","","smart contract platform","ethereum","54.2","47.650980923687385","0.0","89.2","1293","0","33.977425","0"

The Open Campus Protocol is a decentralized solution for educators, content creators, parents, students, and co-publishers designed to address the major challenges in education today. Despite the critical role of educators in shaping the future generation, they are often undervalued and underpaid. Additionally, parents frequently lack control over their children's educational content.

What makes your project unique?
We are the first education protocol that empowers teacher ecosystem to create, own, share and sell their educational content. We will create a EDU foundation that enables content creator to utilize NFT technology to monetize their creation with the financial support from co-publishers.

History of your project.
Open Campus started in 2023, with the support from various launch partners like Animoca Brands, The Sandbox, TinyTap, etc. The protocol's main NFT publication - Publisher NFT was adopted by TinyTap and produced an auction last year with a sale of 243 ETH.

What’s next for your project?
We will continue to build out the marketplace for content creator to create and sell assets, and enable foundation features such as Smart Donation and Scholarship Grants.

What can your token be used for?

It will power all educational activities within the EDU Foundation, that includes a peer review system, Smart donation, purchase and selling of Publisher NFTs and Scholarship granting.","","","education","binance-smart-chain","11.5","43.9137102883083","0.0","16.900000000000002","1452","0","15.905350000000002","0"

It unlocks capital efficiency at scale, auto-balancing allocations based on market conditions while maintaining a conservative risk profile. Spark was created to solve DeFi’s core inefficiencies: fragmented liquidity, unstable yields, and idle stablecoin capital. It acts as a two-sided capital allocator—borrowing from Sky’s $6.5B+ reserves and deploying across DeFi, CeFi, and RWAs to provide deep, consistent liquidity. This yield is packaged into products like sUSDS and sUSDC, offering users programmable, fee-free income. Rather than competing with protocols, Spark powers them as the liquidity and yield infrastructure for onchain finance.

Access to Deep, Scalable Liquidity: Spark taps into Sky’s $6.5B+ stablecoin reserves, enabling large-scale capital deployment across DeFi, CeFi, and RWAs. User-Friendly Yield Products: Yield is delivered through stablecoins like sUSDS and sUSDC—fully composable, fee-free, and available across chains.

SparkLend: A stablecoin lending market. Unlike other lending protocols where rates fluctuate based on utilization or loan size, SparkLend offers governance-defined rates that do not vary based on those factors. This is made possible by Spark’s Liquidity Layer (SLL), which supplies consistent stablecoin liquidity to the protocol.

Spark Savings: A product for earning yield on stablecoins like USDC, and USDS (and soon, USDT) by converting them into yield-bearing sUSDS or sUSDC. These yield tokens are composable with other DeFi protocols, making it easy to put capital to work while maintaining exposure to onchain yield at a competitive risk-adjusted rate.

Spark Liquidity Layer (SLL): A backend capital allocator that routes liquidity to other protocols like Aave, Morpho, and even RWAs (e.g., BlackRock’s BUIDL). One of the most important SLL deployments on Base is the Spark USDC Morpho Vault, which currently supplies $95M USDC, making it the largest liquidity provider to the Coinbase app integration on Base. This vault plays a key role in mitigating rate volatility for borrowers and demonstrates how SLL enhances liquidity conditions across DeFi.

Existing Products: Spark's total TVL is currently $7.9B, split between SparkLend and the Spark Liquidity Layer (SLL). You can find real-time details and breakdowns here: https://defillama.com/protocol/spark#information

Spark in DeFiLlama, https://defillama.com/protocol/spark#information

SparkLend is one of the largest lending protocols in DeFi. It offers deep liquidity and governance-defined rates, providing borrowers with transparent conditions.

Spark Savings is live on Ethereum mainnet, Base, Optimism, Arbitrum, Unichain, and Gnosis, offering vaults for both USDS and USDC.

The Spark Liquidity Layer actively deploys capital across protocols on multiple chains, including Ethereum mainnet, Base, and Arbitrum.

Unlike edge computing and others promoting private, decentralized hosting, The Autonomi Network is autonomous, permanent and has zero subscriptions or recurring fees. To use Autonomi a one-time upload fee is paid to The Network - the uploaded data is then quantum securely encrypted end to end.

With Autonomi, everyday internet users, content creators and app developers will have access to a truly decentralized infrastructure layer - they’re going to be able to build, protect and deploy amazing things. With AI and Robotics changing our world fast, Autonomi will ensure each and everyone of us can be in control of our own knowledge, thoughts and actions.","","100.0","storage","arbitrum-one","21.7","44.94817213014154","93.8139852111125","16.900000000000002","1037","0","48.72764482388937","0"

**What is XION?** 

XION is a blockchain built for everyone, everywhere through chain abstraction. Utilizing its Generalized Abstraction layer, XION distinguishes itself by integrating complex blockchain functionalities, such as accounts, signatures, and interoperability, directly at the protocol level. This approach allows for engagement with blockchain applications without needing to understand the underlying technologies. XION is the native utility token that is used for: 
- Network Usage Fees: Transactions on the XION network incur fees, which are used innovatively to offset the minting of new tokens. This mechanism means that as network usage increases, the offsetting of fees could lead to a deflationary token model. 
- Proof of Stake Security: As a proof-of-stake network, XION relies on validators to maintain its integrity. $XION token holders can delegate their tokens to validators or stake their tokens to run their own validator nodes. In addition, instead of calculating inflation against all tokens, the XION network calculates against only staked tokens. This vastly reduces the token’s overall inflation, leading to much more sustainable economics of the network. 
- Governance: $XION token holders can actively participate in network governance by proposing and voting on proposals. 
- Medium of Exchange & Collateral: $XION can be utilized as native liquidity and collateral within the ecosystem. It can also facilitate peer-to-peer transactions across applications and accounts within the XION ecosystem. 

**What makes XION unique?** 

Generalized Abstraction Layer: XION's foundational feature is its Generalized Abstraction layer, designed to simplify blockchain technology's complexities. This innovation aims to address the primary challenges that have prevented widespread blockchain adoption, providing a comprehensive solution for users and developers. 

Meta Accounts: A distinctive element of XION, Meta Accounts, abstracts the traditional key model, enabling varied authentication methods. This feature facilitates a user-friendly transition from traditional web experiences to blockchain-based applications. 

Signature and Device Abstraction: Through a signature-agnostic approach, XION accommodates transactions authenticated via common methods like email and biometrics. This inclusivity extends to device usage, ensuring seamless interactions across multiple platforms, thereby boosting security and user accessibility. 

Parameterized Fee Layer: XION introduces a parameterized fee system that abstracts fees, enhancing user convenience. Furthermore, this system supports transactions denominated in stablecoins, such as USDC, enabling familiar pricing and stability. 

Abstracted Interoperability: Focusing on interoperability, XION ensures that its Meta Accounts are compatible across diverse blockchain ecosystems. This feature enhances the user experience by facilitating effortless cross-chain interactions through chain abstraction. 

**Who are the founders of XION?** 

Burnt is the research and development company that first began contributing to XION blockchain. 

Burnt Banksy, the founder, purchased a painting by the internationally famous artist Banksy, incinerated it, and then created an authenticated 1 of 1 NFT representation, selling it for more than the original physical artwork. His actions demonstrated the concept of digital scarcity on the world stage, making NFT community history and receiving universal acclaim in the process. The story was covered by leading publications including Bloomberg, CoinDesk, GQ, CoinTelegraph, BBC, CBS, HYPEBEAST, Art.Net, TechCrunch, and many others. He is often cited as one of the catalysts for NFTs as well as being cited in the wikipedia for the word NFT. 

**How is XION secured?** 

XION operates on a Tendermint-based proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Prominent validators help to secure the network while making it more decentralized as well. 

XION is backed by industry leaders such as Animoca, Circle, Multicoin, Arrington, Spartan, Draper Dragon, Hashkey, GoldenTree, Mechanism, Morningstar Ventures, Figment, Play Ventures, Valor, Sfermion, Kucoin Ventures, MH Ventures, Laser Digital (Nomura) and more.","","100.0","smart contract platform","base","93.2","44.44035844060149","91.78954261791066","98.9","4323","0","68.54983991626872","0"

The BounceBit network is secured by staking both Bitcoin and BounceBit tokens. BounceBit's PoS mechanism introduces a unique dual-token staking system by leveraging native BTC security with full EVM compatibility.

In a groundbreaking move, BounceBit introduces the mixed DeFi and CeFi yield mechanism, allowing BTC holders to earn yields through native validator staking, DeFi ecosystem, and a CeFi mirroring mechanism powered by Ceffu and Mainnet Digital.

The $BB token has several uses on the BounceBit platform:

Staking: Stake $BB to actively participate in the PoS dual-token staking mechanism.

Protocol Incentive: The token is paid out as staking reward to validators who secure the network.

Gas: $BB is the denomination of the gas fees that are required to conduct transactions and execute smart contracts.

Governance: Use $BB to participate in on-chain governance, e.g. voting on protocol upgrades.

Currency: $BB can be used as currency on the BounceBit platform. It can be used in various applications and infrastructure, as medium of exchange or store of value.


BounceBit’s Layer 1 consists of the following components:

Dual-token PoS: A hybrid consensus mechanism where each validator can accept both $BBTC and $BB tokens;

Native LSD module: A module allowing the delegation of staking to validators and receiving a LST voucher in return.

BounceBit has a foundational CeFi layer which consists of below components:

Regulated Custody: All user funds are stored in secure custody solutions utilizing MPC wallets.

Off-Exchange Settlement (OES): OES enables safe access to CEX liquidity, while transactions are settled off-exchange.","","","smart contract platform","solana","67.60000000000001","34.55470579215871","0.0","93.89999999999999","1735","0","35.1609","0"

Customers connect to the Orchid Market and pay bandwidth sellers in order to form a proxy chain to a specific resource on the Internet.

Unlike more common methods for sending and receiving data from the global Internet, proxy chains in the Orchid Market naturally separate information about the source of data from information about its destination; no single relay or proxy holds both pieces of information, or knows the identity of someone who does. The structure of the Orchid Market further supports this separation of information by providing strong resistance against collusion attacks – the ability of a group of bandwidth sellers to overcome this separation of knowledge.

The Internet was originally an open platform where people could freely learn and communicate. Unfortunately, as the Internet grew it became a place where people could be monitored, controlled, and censored. We're building a new civil contract around a distributed marketplace for computation, storage, and bandwidth to provide the framework for a new form of digital citizenship.

Virgo will operate solely on smart contracts and will use the funds in the treasury to purchase tokens that are voted on by M87 token stakers. Virgo's immutable smart contracts will purchase the proposed upon tokens and delegate these to M87 token stakers.

Dacxi Coin is the engine that powers the Dacxi Chain; the world’s first global tokenized crowdfunding system. Harnessing blockchain technology and tokenization, the Dacxi Chain creates digital versions of company shares that can be easily bought and sold by anyone, anywhere, at any time. In doing so, it aims to solve the fundamental flaws that have held crowdfunding back from the trillion-dollar industry that leading companies such as IBM believe it could (and should) be.  
First launched in 2017, Dacxi Coin is the Dacxi Chain’s native cryptocurrency. As such, it plays a vital role in the Dacxi Chain’s operation. Dacxi Coin is responsible for facilitating global investment transfers, paying fees on the Dacxi Chain blockchain, node staking, and as the currency for the Dacxi Chain’s global crowdfunding network. The Dacxi Chain aims to unleash innovation around the world, by seamlessly connecting entrepreneurs with everyday investors who can offer the funding they need to succeed. When the Dacxi Chain is fully up and running, demand for Dacxi Coin is projected to reach billions. This makes Dacxi Coin one to closely watch.  

What makes Dacxi Coin Unique?
As the native crypto of the Dacxi Chain, Dacxi Coin has a strong and sound use case – using blockchain technology to solve real-world problem. The early stage funding crisis is sealing the fate of thousands of world-changing products and ideas each year. Crowdfunding as we know it today has failed to reach the heights it promised – held back by limitations like geographical borders, lack of scale, and lack of buzz. 
In delivering the world’s first global tokenized crowdfunding system, the Dacxi Chain will break down these barriers. Opening the door for everyday investors to fund exciting new projects. Connecting entrepreneurs with the capital they need to grow their businesses. And unleashing the world’s innovation potential.

TruFin’s first product, TruStake, is a MATIC staking vault which provides access to MATIC staking on the Ethereum network. TruMATIC is the liquid staking token users receive when they deposit MATIC into the TruStake vault. It is an ERC-20 token like MATIC and has all the same basic functionality. As soon as a user deposits MATIC on the TruStake smart contract, they receive newly minted TruMATIC, based on the exchange rate at the time of staking. As MATIC staking rewards accrue, the value of TruMATIC increases (with reference to MATIC).

- Users have have the ability to stake their MATIC through TruFin’s [dApp](https://app.trufin.io/).
- When a user stakes with TruFin, they will mint a new liquid token — TruMATIC.
- Rewards are restaked automatically, giving an uplift in APY from the compounding effect.

The TruMATIC liquid token is self-custodied, meaning holders have complete control over their TruMATIC at all times, with a broad set of possibilities:

- **Target ~5%+ APY:** TruMATIC will deliver optimised staking rewards on the staked MATIC. Auto-restaking means your APY rides on the power of compounding.
- **DeFi Interoperability:** TruMATIC’s token design ensures seamless integration with a myriad of DeFi protocols — from DEXs to lending/borrowing protocols to yield optimizers.
- **Liquidity Pools:** Get ready for MATIC<>TruMATIC liquidity pools on leading DEXs, enabling a smooth liquidity provision for users seeking to exit their TruMATIC positions.","","","polygon ecosystem","ethereum","1.9","40.65136749044914","0.0","16.900000000000002","1699","0","15.909999999999998","0"

dForce DAO is a community-driven project, with major protocol changes driven by the community and jointly decided by DF token holders through governance. 

Stablecoin USX
USX is the most important DeFi primitive within dForce’s protocol matrix. As a decentralized and algorithmic stablecoin, USX implements a dual model (pool-based & vault-based) with hybrid interest rate policy, making it highly efficient and flexible to support collaterals of different risk profiles in isolation. USX is powered by protocol-controlled liquidity to facilitate protocol-to-protocol integrations, as well as cross-chain bridge that allow users to move USX across supported blockchains with zero slippage and uncapped limit.  

dForce Lending 
dForce Lending is a pool-based multi-sided lending protocol which supports multiple collaterals with a market-driven dynamic interest rate model. dForce Lending has undergone extensive code reviews and security audits by Trail of Bits, ConsenSys Diligence, CertiK, Certora (formal verification), with a bug bounty launched through Immunefi. dForce Lending has been deployed for over 1 year and is well battle-tested.

dForce Staking
dForce introduces a hybrid model featuring both Free Staking and Lock-up Staking. Staking unlocks a new approach for DF token holders to capture fee income across dForce network. Participants in Free Staking can unstake at any time, whilst those committed to Lock-up Staking will earn higher yield and voting power. In addition, most of DF purchased in the secondary market will be rewarded to participants in Lock-up Staking. 

dForce Trading
Peer-to-peer marketplace with aggregated liquidity across different platforms with the best price.

dForce Bridge
A cross-chain bridging tool facilitating instant and low-cost transfer of USX and DF across all supported L2s and blockchains.

""The eyes and ears of spatial AI""

Without spatial awareness, AI is confined to the internet and blind to the world around it. Spatial computing and machine perception bring AI's power to the physical world.

The posemesh is a decentralized spatial computing and machine perception network for the next 100 billion people, devices and AI.

Traction & Milestones

- 700+ posemesh domains around the world; anyone can create their own domain by grabbing a portal kit and setting it up within minutes. We have another app called McKenna for decorating domains with NFTs, images, videos, 3D assets, and text notes.
- 6+ month pilot with Coop (a major grocery retailer in Sweden) integrating spatial AI and staff productivity, saving them more than 15 minutes per employee per day and increasing their self-sufficiency.
- 2+ month multi-store pilot with another major Swedish grocery retailer that has committed to doing a complete rollout in the coming 12 months, plus a number of others in Hong Kong.
- Top 10 global retailers are interested in Spatial AI to do empty shelf detection and planogram compliance; they’ve also expressed strong interest in ESL positioning and realograms (having a detailed understanding of where items are in their stores).
- Pre-pilot planning with more of Europe and North America's largest grocery retailers; a combined total of 40,000+ stores and hundreds of thousands of employees.
- Real-time indoor navigation and friend finding at a number of large events and venues.
- 40k DePIN app users on TG
- 300+ DePIN servers around the world (purposely capped to avoid over-provisioning)
- 450+ app developers using the posemesh SDK for building shared and persistent AR experiences

A New decentralized network model which leverages techniques that differ from common block chain constructions. Directly, 
it does not build consensus around a block chain, but indirectly, a block chain or any other data structure may be maintained within the shards of the hypergraph.

Quilibrium’s network design utilizes cryptographic approaches to provide unforgeably valid transitions of state, such that adverse conditions are structurally impossible, and malicious behaviors are implicitly punishable by removal and reveal.","","","smart contract platform","ethereum","44.9","41.52641085278752","0.0","74.7","914","0","30.33735","0"

CUDOS powers a decentralised compute network that will interoperate with multiple blockchain ecosystems to provide the following benefits:

1. Trusted layer 1 validator network built on the Tendermint protocol - Wasm compatibility, for smart contracts to be deployed on CUDOS using next-generation languages so long as they compile to WebAssembly. I.e. Golang, Rust, Java etc.

2. Cross-chain or Horizontal interoperability thanks to the network’s Inter Blockchain Communication (IBC) integration, allowing Cudos Network smart contracts to interface with multiple networks.

3. 10x lower transaction and gas costs compared to those on PoW networks - A massively scalable network to facilitate more sophisticated smart contract operations

4. Higher performance with anywhere between 200 to 500 Peak TPS on the network - access to a globally distributed layer 3 network of secure cloud, and compute, resources

Turing complete solutions for non-Turing complete Layer 1 blockchain networks. With the underlying Cudo platform live in over 145 countries, across enterprise and edge environments, and used by over 250,000 users, CUDOS is the next major release, providing a decentralised computing layer bridging on-chain and off-chain resources.

The CUDOS token serves the following clear purposes: Transaction payments, Network governance and operations, a staking mechanism for receiving blockchain and cloud workloads, and a medium of exchange (MoE). 

What is CUDOS trying to solve? 
Scaling on blockchain is both expensive and limited in the type of use-cases it can support. CUDOS solves this issue by providing a highly scalable Layer 2 and 3 solution, connecting both on-chain and off-chain consumers to the network via smart contracts and APIs. 

Who are the founders at CUDOS?
CUDOS was founded by Mathew Hawkins, an award-winning entrepreneur, who previously founded C4L, a data center, cloud and network infrastructure provider that grew to support 1% of the UK’s internet infrastructure. Exiting in 2016 for $30m, Mathew started Cudo and the CUDOS network to build infrastructure services in software, what he previously achieved in hardware. The executive team have backgrounds in building and scaling and SaaS with COO Lee Woodham, who has over 25 years split across scaling financial services and tech companies. The board of advisors also includes David Juxon, former MD of Bank of America, Chris Deering, Former President of Sony Entertainment (Playstation), Joerg Roskowetz, Director of Blockchain for AMD and Maggie Fang, early investor in Uber and Alibaba. 

What makes CUDOS unique? 
CUDOS is the first decentralised computing network to provide services to both on-chain and off-chain infrastructure consumers. Built on the Cosmos blockchain and utilising the Tendermint protocol for secure BFT consensus, the CUDOS validator network will provide a globally distributed and highly secure network able to allocate more intensive workloads out to the underlying Layer 3 Cudo platform. 

How is the CUDOS network secured? 
The CUDOS Network utilises the Byzantine Fault Tolerant Bonded Proof of Stake mechanism featured in the Cosmos SDK, known as Tendermint Core, as its consensus engine. Validators in the CUDOS network stake a given amount of CUDOS in order to earn fees from validating transactions on the network in a secure and highly reliable way. In order to achieve this, the CUDOS Network also leverages the Cosmos SDK’s staking, slashing, and governance modules to incentivise a minimum of 95% uptime and to swiftly eliminate validators known to perform double-signs or other known forms of bad actor behaviours. 

Who are the major partners of CUDOS?
CUDOS is partnered with major and recognised brands across both blockchain and enterprise computing verticals, including AMD, Ultra & Algorand. Strategic backers include Outlier Ventures (OV), Moonwhale, Moonrock, Brilliance Ventures, GBV, Spincrypto, Double Peak, Coinvision, and BMW Capital. 

How many CUDOS coins are there in circulation?
There is a maximum supply of 10 billion CUDOS tokens released over a 10 year period (starting from the 11th January 2021). The total supply of 10 billion CUDOS is distributed via multiple allocations, with 34% Ecosystem & Community Development, 33.78% Reserve, 20% Team (2% released based per milestone achieved. 10 key pre-determined milestones), 5% Advisors and 7.22% to presale token holders. Use of funds will be as follows: 30% Research & Product Development, 10% Administration & Operations, 20% marketing, 10% CUDOS Validator Nodes (CVN), 13% User Acquisition, 10% Community Engagement and 7% Contingency. 

Where can you buy CUDOS?
At the time of writing, the top exchanges for CUDOS trading are Ascendex, KuCoin, Gate.io, Uniswap, Bittrex Poloniex, CoinField, Liquid, ZT Global, and others.","","","artificial intelligence (ai)","ethereum","31.1","27.293775775824084","0.0","81.5","4872","0","32.0741","0"

Founded in 2014 as a fork of Bitcoin, Syscoin (SYS) is a trailblazing blockchain network that synergizes the robust security of Bitcoin's Proof of Work (PoW) consensus algorithm with the versatility of Ethereum's smart contract functionality. Syscoin is not just a blockchain; it's a full-stack, modular ecosystem that includes Rollux, the industry's most competitive EVM Layer 2 rollup solution. Due to its modularity, it is worth noting that Syscoin has three chains, its UTXO and [N]EVM chains comprise its Layer 1, and its Layer 2 currently consists of Rollux.

Rollux sets a new standard for Ethereum-compatible dApps by being the only EVM L2 secured by Bitcoin through merged mining. It's grounded in OP Stack and features PoDA (Proof-of-Data Availability), the most advanced data availability solution in the industry. This unique architecture makes Rollux the most secure, performant, affordable, and scalable rollup for Ethereum-compatible dApps.

Syscoin aims to be at the forefront of smart contract applications, spanning Metaverse, IoT, Smart Cities, and even interplanetary economies. Looking forward, its roadmap is rich with cutting-edge technologies, including various ZK technologies like rollups, and DAOSYS—a revolutionary DAO model designed for governance-free treasury management and self-sovereignty for all participants.

Envisioning a world with unprecedented financial inclusion, Syscoin seeks to empower every individual and business to benefit from Web3 and beyond. It brings together the capabilities of Ethereum and the original vision of Satoshi Nakamoto for Bitcoin, opening up unparalleled possibilities for a decentralized future.

Syscoin offers its unique version of EVM, known as Network Enhanced Virtual Machine (NEVM), allowing it to host Ethereum-compatible smart contracts and rollups. In addition to Rollux, Syscoin features other Layer-2 solutions like Z-DAG and the Syscoin Bridge, further enhancing its scalability, interoperability, and performance.","","75.0","smart contract platform","unknown","68.7","41.485120455174766","95.0696047043359","76.8","2029","0","64.16566164651756","0"

The Derive DAO earns trading fees from the Derive Protocol and gas fees from the Derive Chain, governed by DRV token holders. Trading fees accrue to an insurance fund to foster robustness of the protocol and rollup.

Derive has built an AI-powered trading app built for pro traders. In collaboration with Messari, Derive Pro translates market views into trades. The agent then prepares transactions for users and leverages smart contract wallets to make trades one-click, gasless and chainless. The app will support spot, perps and options trading on Derive, and will also plug in to spot AMMs on L2s like Optimism, Arbitrum and Base.","","100.0","smart contract platform","ethereum","36.7","62.55737276816182","0.0","60.699999999999996","940","0","26.838849999999997","0"

Ankr Staking offers Ethereum token holders the opportunity to stake ETH and, in return, claim ETH Liquid Staking tokens — ankrETH. ankrETH also offers instant liquidity for your staked ETH, enabling you to connect ankrETH with DeFi platforms and earn several more layers of rewards.

ankrETH is a reward-bearing token, meaning that the fair value of 1 ankrETH token vs. ETH increases over time as staking rewards accumulate inside the token.

Benefits

- Generate Multiple Layers of Rewards: Use ankrETH on DeFi platforms to enable you to multiply your earning potential in APY on top of your staking rewards!
- Low Impermanent Loss: Contributing ankrETH for liquidity with tokens like ETH means a low risk of impermanent loss, expanding the upside of providing liquidity for a more stable and profitable experience.
- Compound Your Staking Rewards: Your staking rewards will compound daily as the value of ankrETH in your wallet increases vs. ETH.
- Support & Secure Ethereum: Staking ETH directly supports the Ethereum network and helps validate transactions. Ankr’s staking system distributes staked tokens intelligently across the Ethereum ecosystem to achieve optimal decentralization.
- Elastic Supply: Users can trade their ankrETH tokens for their staked ETH anytime.

Its core functions remain intact as Stride adopts Interchain Security (ICS). STRD holders can continue staking their tokens to receive rewards, a combination of both STRD and rewards derived from liquid staked tokens. This allows them to actively engage in on-chain decisions and voting processes, influencing choices like validator selection and upgrades. 

To ensure sustainability, the emission of STRD as staking rewards was decreased in half from the original tokenomics. A portion of staking rewards, 15%, is shared with the Cosmos Hub, fostering collaboration between the two ecosystems.

Project Overview

Capital in DeFi is extremely fragmented across chains, evidenced by the dozens of different money markets, all with their own liquidity.

Radiant aims to be an omnichain money market where users can deposit any major asset on any major chain and borrow various supported assets across multiple chains, eliminating the need for silos of liquidity.

Radiant’s cross-chain interoperability functions using LayerZero messaging and Stargate's stable router interface. For example, lenders may reclaim their collateral and can direct which chain to withdraw funds from and what percentage they’d like sent to each chain.

Radiant aims to solve DeFi 1.0 issues of unpredictable and transient liquidity through its innovative Dynamic Liquidity Providers (dLP) and gated emissions.

Value Proposition

Consolidation of Fragmented Liquidity: The primary goal of the Radiant DAO is to consolidate billions in fragmented liquidity across multiple lending protocols and chains under one safe, user-friendly, and capital-efficient cross-chain protocol. This consolidation of fragmented liquidity is intended to enhance the overall DeFi ecosystem and create a more seamless experience for users.

Gated Emissions: Sustainability is an important Key Performance Indicator to the Radiant DAO and thus the protocol implemented a Dynamic Liquidity (dLP) mechanism which only enables incentivized RDNT emissions to dLP providers. Dynamic Liquidity Provisioners also share in the utility of platform fees captured in blue-chip assets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB, and stablecoins through borrowing interest, flash loans, and liquidations.

Project Key Highlights

Omnichain Money Market: Users can deposit and borrow assets across chains seamlessly within minutes via Radiant’s integrations with LayerZero and the Stargate stable router interface, which solves many DeFi pain points related to requiring multiple transactions to lend, borrow, bridge, and swap.

DeFi 3.0: Early iterations of DeFi featured many copycat protocols with zero utility and high-emission governance tokens. In the Radiant DAO’s V2 launch, Radiant will continue to allow all users to borrow and lend cross-chain, seamlessly. However, emissions are gated to only users which provide utility to the protocol in the form of Dynamic Liquidity Provisioning

Support for 20+ Collateral Options: As the Radiant DAO expands its cross-chain functionality to additional chains, new collateral options will emerge with DAO-voted Loan-To-Value parameters and oracle usage.","","100.0","bnb chain ecosystem","arbitrum-one","53.0","41.39221629333713","0.0","81.89999999999999","2585","0","32.16974999999999","0"
