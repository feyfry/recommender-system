It enables peer-to-peer electronic cash transactions without intermediaries like banks or governments, operating on a blockchain secured by Proof of Work mining and the SHA-256 cryptographic algorithm. 

With a fixed supply cap of 21 million coins and programmatic halvings every four years that reduce miner rewards, Bitcoin is designed as a deflationary digital asset often called ""digital gold."" Its value stems from solving the double-spending problem without trusted intermediaries, creating the first truly scarce digital asset with censorship resistance and permissionless access that no government, corporation, or individual can control.

Bitcoin operates as a decentralized peer-to-peer network where transactions are recorded on a public ledger called the blockchain, distributed across thousands of computers globally. Transactions are grouped into blocks added approximately every 10 minutes through mining, where specialized computers compete to solve complex mathematical puzzles. 

Bitcoin has achieved mainstream adoption through multiple vectors. The January 2024 SEC approval of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs opened Bitcoin investment to traditional finance participants, and corporations like Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) are using Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset to protect against currency debasement, offering MSTR holders amplified exposure to Bitcoin. 

The Bitcoin ecosystem continues to evolve with innovations like Ordinals, which emerged in January 2023 to enable NFT-like functionality directly on Bitcoin, and BRC-20 tokens, an experimental standard for creating fungible tokens using Ordinal inscriptions. BTCFi (Bitcoin Finance) represents emerging financial applications extending beyond Bitcoin's traditional role, with protocols like Babylon allowing Bitcoin holders to stake BTC to secure Proof of Stake chains.

In other words, it is a decentralized blockchain platform that enables developers to build and deploy smart contracts and applications without central authority control. Unlike Bitcoin, which primarily functions as digital currency, Ethereum operates as a programmable global computer where developers can create any type of decentralized service. 

The platform hosts over $14 billion in DeFi applications with hundreds of thousands of active users across financial protocols, NFT marketplaces, and gaming platforms. Its transition to Proof of Stake in September 2022 reduced energy consumption by over 99%, addressing environmental concerns while strengthening network security.

The network operates through thousands of independent validator nodes that process transactions and execute smart contracts on the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Smart contracts are self-executing programs written in Solidity that automatically carry out agreements when conditions are met, eliminating intermediaries like banks or brokers. 

Validators stake ETH as collateral to propose and validate blocks, earning rewards for honest participation while facing penalties for malicious behavior. The EIP-1559 upgrade introduced a dynamic base fee mechanism that burns ETH with each transaction, creating deflationary pressure during high network activity when more ETH is burned than issued to validators.

Vitalik Buterin proposed Ethereum in 2013, but seven co-founders helped build it, including Gavin Wood who created Solidity and the EVM technical specification, and Joseph Lubin who founded ConsenSys. The project launched in July 2015 after raising over $18 million through crowdfunding, quickly becoming the largest blockchain developer community. Major milestones include the 2020 Beacon Chain launch, the 2021 London hard fork implementing fee burning, and the 2022 Merge to Proof of Stake. 

Ether (ETH) serves multiple functions: paying transaction fees (gas), staking to secure the network and earn 3-5% annual yields, serving as collateral in DeFi protocols, and purchasing NFTs and digital assets. The asset is increasingly adopted by traditional institutions, with publicly traded companies adding ETH to corporate treasuries to generate staking yields while maintaining blockchain exposure, and in 2024, the SEC approved spot Ethereum ETFs, allowing traditional investors to gain exposure through conventional brokerage accounts.

Ethereum's roadmap focuses on dramatically increasing transaction capacity to over 100,000 per second, reducing confirmation times, and enhancing decentralization while maintaining security against future threats like quantum computing.","2015-07-30","76.72","smart contract platform","unknown","76.0","36.55117050340048","99.93025267181108","20.0","2750","3842","64.90873843513387","0"

The idea was to create a stable cryptocurrency that can be used like digital dollars. Coins that serve this purpose of being a stable dollar substitute are called “stable coins.” Tether is the most popular stable coin and even acts as a dollar replacement on many popular exchanges! According to their site, Tether converts cash into digital currency, to anchor or “tether” the value of the coin to the price of national currencies like the US dollar, the Euro, and the Yen. Like other cryptos it uses blockchain. Unlike other cryptos, it is [according to the official Tether site] “100% backed by USD” (USD is held in reserve). The primary use of Tether is that it offers some stability to the otherwise volatile crypto space and offers liquidity to exchanges who can’t deal in dollars and with banks (for example to the sometimes controversial but leading exchange Bitfinex)

The digital coins are issued by a company called Tether Limited that is governed by the laws of the British Virgin Islands, according to the legal part of its website. It is incorporated in Hong Kong. It has emerged that Jan Ludovicus van der Velde is the CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, which has been accused of being involved in the price manipulation of bitcoin, as well as tether. Many people trading on exchanges, including Bitfinex, will use tether to buy other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Tether Limited argues that using this method to buy virtual currencies allows users to move fiat in and out of an exchange more quickly and cheaply. Also, exchanges typically have rocky relationships with banks, and using Tether is a way to circumvent that.

USDT is fairly simple to use. Once on exchanges like Poloniex or Bittrex, it can be used to purchase Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. It can be easily transferred from an exchange to any Omni Layer enabled wallet. Tether has no transaction fees, although external wallets and exchanges may charge one. In order to convert USDT to USD and vise versa through the Tether.to Platform, users must pay a small fee. Buying and selling Tether for Bitcoin can be done through a variety of exchanges like the ones mentioned previously or through the Tether.to platform, which also allows the conversion between USD to and from your bank account.

It is a trading platform exclusively for cryptocurrencies. The name ""Binance"" is a combination of binary and finance.

Thus, the startup name shows that only cryptocurrencies can be traded against each other. It is not possible to trade crypto currencies against Fiat. The platform achieved an enormous success within a very short time and is focused on worldwide market with Malta headquarters. The cryptocurrency currently has a daily trading volume of 1.5 billion - 2 billion US dollars and is still increasing.

In total, there will only be 200 million BNBs. Binance uses the ERC20 token standard from Ethereum and has distributed it as follow: 50% sold on ICO, 40% to the team and 10% to Angel investors. The coin can be used to pay fees on Binance. These include trading fees, transaction fees, listing fees and others. Binance gives you a huge discount when fees are paid in BNB. 

The schedule of BNB fees discount is as follow: In the first year, 50% discount on all fees, second year 25% discount, third year 12.5% discount, fourth year 6.75 % discount, and from the fifth year onwards there is no discount. This structure is used to incentivize users to buy BNB and do trades within Binance.

Binance announced in a buyback plan that it would buy back up to 100 million BNB in Q1 2018. The coins are then burned. This means that they are devaluated to increase the value of the remaining coins. This benefits investors. In the future, the cryptocurrency will remain an asset on the trading platform and will be used as gas.

Other tokens that are issued by exchanges include Bibox Token, OKB, Huobi Token, and more.","2017-07-08","23.08","smart contract platform","ethereum","75.6","43.495869573992664","99.60154928353572","20.0","1696","3133","64.37189224923749","0"

Like other cryptocurrencies, Ripple is built atop the idea of a distributed ledger network which requires various parties to participate in validating transactions, rather than any singular centralized authority. That facilitates transactions all over the world, and transfer fees are far cheaper than the likes of bitcoin. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, XRP transfers are effectively immediate, requiring no typical confirmation time.

Ripple was originally founded by a single company, Ripple Labs, and continues to be backed by it, rather than the larger network of developers that continue bitcoin’s development. It also doesn’t have a fluctuating amount of its currency in existence. Where bitcoin has a continually growing pool with an eventual maximum, and Ethereum theoretically has no limit, Ripple was created with all of its 100 billion XRP tokens right out of the gate. That number is maintained with no mining and most of the tokens are owned and held by Ripple Labs itself — around 60 billion at the latest count.

Even at the recently reduced value of around half a dollar per XRP, that means Ripple Labs is currently sitting on around $20 billion worth of the cryptocurrency (note: Ripple’s price crashed hard recently, and may be worth far less than $60 billion by time you read this). It holds 55 billion XRP in an escrow account, which allows it to sell up to a billion per month if it so chooses in order to fund new projects and acquisitions. Selling such an amount would likely have a drastic effect on the cryptocurrency’s value, and isn’t something Ripple Labs plans to do anytime soon.

In actuality, Ripple Labs is looking to leverage the technology behind XRP to allow for faster banking transactions around the world. While Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are built on the idea of separating financial transactions from the financial organizations of traditional currencies, Ripple is almost the opposite in every sense.

XRP by Ripple price can be found on this page alongside the market capitalization and additional stats.

It distinguishes itself by scaling globally without the use of complex sharding or multiple layers, instead maintaining a single, unified ledger to avoid liquidity fragmentation. This architecture allows it to process thousands of transactions per second with sub-second finality, often at a cost of less than a penny per transaction.

The network operates on a unique hybrid model that combines Proof of Stake with an innovation called Proof of History, which functions as a decentralized clock to timestamp transactions. This system reduces the need for constant node communication, allowing the Sealevel engine to run non-conflicting smart contracts in parallel across multiple CPU cores. Further efficiency is gained through the Gulf Stream protocol, which reduces confirmation times by forwarding transactions to validators before the current block is finished.

Founded in 2017 by Anatoly Yakovenko, Solana is now supported by the Switzerland-based Solana Foundation and significant institutional investors like Andreessen Horowitz and Polychain Capital. The platform’s native token, SOL, serves as the primary currency for paying transaction fees, participating in network governance, and securing the system through staking. 

Solana has also seen significant institutional adoption ranging from spot Solana ETFs to major partnerships including Visa's 2025 launch of USDC settlement on the network and the tokenization of public equity by firms like Galaxy Digital.","","68.12","smart contract platform","unknown","99.4","69.69622553885202","99.74117812563388","40.0","1640","0","56.71978734397186","1"

Tron's mission is to build a truly decentralized internet and aims to be the largest blockchain-based operating system in the world, known as the TRON protocol. The TRON protocol will offer high scalability, high availability, and high throughput computing to serve decentralized applications via smart contracts. Ethereum EVM-based smart contracts will be compatible and deployable on the TRON network as such Solidity developers do not have to rewrite their applications.

Why Tron?
Since TRON protocol does not rely on proof of work or mining, instead governed by nodes located around the world, it is decentralized while providing high throughput for transactions on the blockchain. This is suitable for dapps that require high speed transactions especially games. There are a number of tokens already issued on the TRON network and the decentralized exchanges TRX.market has launched.

On July 24th 2018, TRON acquired BitTorrent, one of the largest P2P file sharing protocol. As a result of the acquisition, BitTorrent Token (BTT) was launched as the cryptocurrency to power the economics on the BitTorrent network. The Token will be used to inceltivize file sharing and storage within the network.

Dogecoin is a Litecoin fork. Introduced as a ""joke currency"" on 6 December 2013, Dogecoin quickly developed its own online community and reached a capitalization of US$60 million in January 2014. Compared with other cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin had a fast initial coin production schedule: 100 billion coins were in circulation by mid-2015, with an additional 5.256 billion coins every year thereafter. As of 30 June 2015, the 100 billionth Dogecoin had been mined. 

Dogecoin was created by Billy Markus from Portland, Oregon and  Jackson Palmer from Sydney, Australia. Both wanted to create a fun cryptocurrency that will appeal beyond the core Bitcoin audience. Dogecoin is primarily used as a tipping system on Reddit and Twitter where users tip each other for creating or sharing good content. The community is very active in organising fundraising activities for deserving causes.

The developers of Dogecoin haven’t made any major changes to the coin since 2015. This means that Dogecoin could get left behind and is why Shibas are leaving Dogecoin to join more advanced platforms like Ethereum. One of Dogecoin strengths is its relaxed and fun-loving community. However, this is also a weakness because other currencies are way more professional.

To purchase Dogecoin, it involves downloading a crypto wallet, setting up a crypto exchange account and then trading away for your desired crypto currency. Once we have set up an account with a DOGE currency exchange and deposited some funds, you are ready to start trading.

What sets Cardano apart is its methodical, research-driven approach — every major feature is peer-reviewed by scientists and cryptographers before being added to the network. This careful process aims to create a more secure and stable foundation compared to platforms that prioritize speed over thorough testing. The platform's native cryptocurrency, ADA, is used to send money, pay transaction fees, and participate in network governance.

Cardano uses a proof-of-stake system to process transactions, which works differently from Bitcoin's mining approach. Instead of competing to solve complex puzzles, users can ""stake"" their ADA — essentially locking it up temporarily — to become validators who verify transactions. The system selects validators based on how much ADA they've staked and for how long, then rewards them with additional ADA for their participation. This approach uses far less energy than traditional mining while keeping the network secure. The platform also features a two-layer design that separates basic payment transactions from smart contract operations, allowing each function to be optimized independently for better performance. 

ADA holders can earn staking rewards by locking up their tokens to help secure the network, vote on proposed changes to the platform, and use ADA for international money transfers with lower fees than traditional services.

Cardano was founded in 2017 by Charles Hoskinson, who previously helped create Ethereum. Hoskinson leads Input Output Global (IOG), the technology company that builds and maintains Cardano's core software. The ecosystem operates through three organizations: IOG handles technical development, the Cardano Foundation promotes adoption and standardization, and Emurgo helps businesses integrate blockchain technology into their operations. This structure distributes responsibilities across multiple groups rather than concentrating control in a single entity. 

In February 2025, major asset manager Grayscale Investments filed to create an exchange-traded fund (ETF) for Cardano with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which would allow traditional investors to buy ADA through their regular brokerage accounts without needing to set up cryptocurrency wallets.Retry","","89.83","smart contract platform","unknown","99.7","40.715471134554704","99.44528028263387","41.9","2480","0","57.100298098921854","0"

Bitcoin Cash intends to be a Bitcoin without Segregated Witness (SegWit) as soft fork, where upgrades of the protocol are done mainly through hard forks and without changing the original economic rules of the Bitcoin.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is released on 1st August 2017 as an upgraded version of the original Bitcoin Core software. The main upgrade is the increase in the block size limit from 1MB to 8MB. This effectively allows miners on the BCH chain to process up to 8 times more payments per second in comparison to Bitcoin. This makes for faster, cheaper transactions and a much smoother user experience.

Why was Bitcoin Cash Created?

The main objective of Bitcoin Cash is to to bring back the essential qualities of money inherent in the original Bitcoin software. Over the years, these qualities were filtered out of Bitcoin Core and progress was stifled by various people, organizations, and companies involved in Bitcoin protocol development. The result is that Bitcoin Core is currently unusable as money due to increasingly high fees per transactions and transfer times taking hours to complete. This is all because of the 1MB limitation of Bitcoin Core’s block size, causing it unable to accommodate to large number of transactions.

Essentially Bitcoin Cash is a community-activated upgrade (otherwise known as a hard fork) of Bitcoin that increased the block size to 8MB, solving the scaling issues that plague Bitcoin Core today.

The Hyperliquid L1 is performant enough to operate an entire ecosystem of permissionless financial applications – every order, cancel, trade, and liquidation happens transparently on-chain with block latency &lt;1 second. The chain currently supports 100k orders / second.

The Hyperliquid L1 uses a custom consensus algorithm called HyperBFT which is heavily inspired by Hotstuff and its successors. Both the algorithm and networking stack are optimized from the ground up to support the L1. 

The flagship native application is a fully onchain order book perpetuals exchange, the Hyperliquid DEX. Further developments include a native token standard, spot trading, permissionless liquidity, etc.","","61.97","decentralized exchange (dex)","hyperliquid","98.1","102.20648934855664","0.0","43.5","940","0","22.665875","1"

""oracle problem"" by connecting smart contracts with real-world data. Blockchains cannot access external information on their own, so Chainlink acts as a secure bridge, enabling smart contracts to react to real-world events using verified, tamper-proof data. It is widely considered one of the first decentralized oracle networks and is the market leader in bringing off-chain data on-chain.

The platform operates through a decentralized network of nodes that fetch, validate, and deliver data to smart contracts. When a contract requests information like a stock price, a committee of independent nodes retrieves and aggregates the data to reach consensus, then delivers a single trustworthy answer. Chainlink offers a suite of services including Data Feeds for asset prices, CCIP for cross-chain token transfers and messaging, Automation for triggering smart contract functions, and Proof of Reserve for verifying asset collateralization.

Chainlink has established itself as critical infrastructure for both DeFi and institutional adoption, with partnerships including Swift, Euroclear, Mastercard, UBS, ANZ, Fidelity International, and J.P. Morgan. Its institutional products include the Chainlink Runtime Environment for tokenized asset workflows, Confidential Compute for privacy-preserving computation, and the Automated Compliance Engine for embedding regulatory rules into smart contracts.

The LINK token is the native asset used to pay node operators for services, fund subscription accounts, and incentivize network security through staking. Node operators stake LINK as collateral, which can be slashed if they provide inaccurate data. Chainlink was co-founded in 2017 by Sergey Nazarov and Steve Ellis, who co-authored the white paper with Ari Juels, and raised $32 million in its September 2017 ICO.","2017-09-16","75.0","artificial intelligence (ai)","ethereum","99.8","38.25199077167734","99.59332252890908","43.9","1900","3063","70.09581288511818","0"

Stellar aims to help facilitate cross-asset transfer of value at a fraction of a penny while aiming to be an open financial system that gives people of all income levels access to low-cost financial services. Stellar can handle exchanges between fiat-based currencies and between cryptocurrencies. Stellar.org, the organization that supports Stellar, is centralized like XRP and meant to handle cross platform transactions and micro transactions like XRP. However, unlike Ripple, Stellar.org is non-profit and their platform itself is open source and decentralized. 

Stellar was founded by Jed McCaleb in 2014. Jed McCaleb is also the founder of Mt. Gox and co-founder of Ripple, launched the network system Stellar with former lawyer Joyce Kim. Stellar is also a payment technology that aims to connect financial institutions and drastically reduce the cost and time required for cross-border transfers. In fact, both payment networks used the same protocol initially.

Distributed Exchange
Through the use of its intermediary currency Lumens (XLM), a user can send any currency that they own to anyone else in a different currency.

For instance, if Joe wanted to send USD to Mary using her EUR, an offer is submitted to the distributed exchange selling USD for EUR. This submitted offer forms is known as an order book. The network will use the order book to find the best exchange rate for the transaction in-order to minimize the fee paid by a user.

This multi-currency transaction is possible because of ""Anchors"". Anchors are trusted entities that hold people’s deposits and can issue credit. In essence, Anchors serves as the bridge between different currencies and the Stellar network.

Lumens (XLM)
Lumens are the native asset (digital currency) that exist on the Stellar network that helps to facilitate multi-currency transactions and prevent spams. For multi-currency transactions, XLM is the digital intermediary that allows for such a transaction to occur at a low cost.

In-order to prevent DoS attacks (aka spams) that would inevitably occur on the Stellar network, a small fee of 0.00001 XLM is associated with every transaction that occurs on the network. This fee is small enough so it does not significantly affect the cost of transaction, but large enough so it dissuades bad actors from spamming the network. 

Prior to Protocol 12, Stellar had a built-in inflation mechanism conceived to allow account holders to collectively direct inflation-generated lumens toward projects built on Stellar.

As the network evolved and grew, it became increasingly clear that inflation wasn’t working as intended — account holders either didn’t set their inflation destination or joined inflation pools to claim the inflation themselves, and the operational costs associated with inflation payments continued to rise — and so a protocol change to disable inflation was proposed, implemented, voted on by validators, and ultimately adopted as part of a network upgrade.

The inflation operation is now deprecated.

WETH is the tokenized/packaged form of ETH that you use to pay for items when you interact with Ethereum dApps. WETH follows the ERC-20 token standards, enabling it to achieve interoperability with other ERC-20 tokens. 

This offers more utility to holders as they can use it across networks and dApps. You can stake, yield farm, lend, and provide liquidity to various liquidity pools with WETH. 

Also, unlike ETH, which doesn’t conform to its own ERC-20 standard and thus has lower interoperability as it can’t be used on other chains besides Ethereum, WETH can be used on cheaper and high throughput alternatives like Binance, Polygon, Solana, and Cardano.

The price of WETH will always be the same as ETH because it maintains a 1:1 wrapping ratio.

How to Wrap ETH?
Custodians wrap and unwrap ETH. To wrap ETH, you send ETH to a custodian. This can be a multi-sig wallet, a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), or a smart contract. After connecting your web3 wallet to a DeFi exchange, you enter the amount of ETH you wish to wrap and click the swap function. Once the transaction is confirmed, you will receive WETH tokens equivalent to the ETH that you’ve swapped.

On a centralized exchange, the exchange burns the deposited ETH and mints a wrapped form for you. And when you want to unwrap it, the exchange will burn the wrapped version and mint the ETH on your behalf.

What’s Next for WETH?
According to the developers, hopefully there will be no future for WETH. According to the website, steps are being taken to update ETH to make it compliant with its own ERC-20 standards. ","2016-06-17","100.0","crypto-backed tokens","ethereum","43.6","37.07268657789207","0.0","20.0","1640","3519","29.810375","0"

It was the first cryptocurrency to implement zero-knowledge encryption for private peer-to-peer payments, addressing the fundamental privacy gap in traditional cryptocurrencies that expose transaction details publicly. 

With a fixed supply of 21 million ZEC and a halving schedule similar to Bitcoin, Zcash allows users to prove transactions are valid without revealing sensitive information like wallet balances, transaction amounts, or participant identities, making it suitable for everyday payments, long-term savings, and cross-border money transfers where financial confidentiality matters.

The protocol operates on its own blockchain currently using Proof-of-Work consensus, though it's evolving toward Proof-of-Stake through the planned ""Crosslink"" upgrade to enhance security, scalability, and energy efficiency. Zcash employs trustless zero-knowledge proofs (Halo) within its Orchard shielded pool to verify transactions without revealing sender, receiver, or amount information. 

Users can choose between transparent public transactions and shielded private transactions through Unified Addresses, which work with both types. The network is faster and cheaper than Bitcoin, with new blocks mined every 75 seconds and transaction fees typically just a fraction of a cent. Privacy adoption has surged in 2025, with over 30% of total ZEC supply now held in fully shielded pools.

Zcash was created by a group of scientists in 2013 who initially proposed Zerocoin as a privacy extension to Bitcoin before building a standalone protocol. The ecosystem operates with a self-funded development model where block rewards support independent teams through the Zcash Community Grants Committee and a new Coinholder-Controlled Fund.","2016-10-28","75.0","smart contract platform","near-protocol","99.2","32.30264188333114","99.60806445852911","41.699999999999996","1922","3386","70.02672256048518","0"

It was created based on the Bitcoin protocol but differs in terms of the hashing algorithm used. Litecoin uses the memory intensive Scrypt proof of work mining algorithm. Scrypt allows consumer-grade hardware such as GPU to mine those coins.

Why Litecoin?
Litecoin is a cryptocurrency that has evolved from Bitcoin after its own popularity in the industry, this alternative, or ‘altcoin’ has emerged to allow investors to diversify their digital currency package, according to Investopedia. Litecoin is one of the most prominent altcoins and was created by former Google employee and Director of Engineering at Coinbase, Charlie Lee. Litecoin was the first to alter Bitcoin and the most significant difference is that it takes 2.5 minutes for Litecoin to generate a block, or transaction, in comparison to Bitcoin's 10 minutes.

‘While this matters little to traders, miners who use hardware to run Bitcoin's network cannot switch over to Litecoin. This keeps bigger mining conglomerates away from Litecoin because they cannot easily optimize their profits by swapping to another coin, contributing to a more decentralized experience. Litecoin also has bigger blocks, and more coins in circulation, making it more affordable and swift when transacting,’ Investopedia explained.

As explained above, Litecoin can transact a lot faster than Bitcoin, but there are also a number of other characteristics that investors need to know before trading. Litecoin can handle higher volumes of transactions because of the capability of transacting faster and if Bitcoin attempted to transact on the scale of its altcoin, a code update would be needed. However, Litecoin’s blocks would be larger, but with more ‘orphaned blocks'. The faster block time of litecoin reduces the risk of double spending attacks - this is theoretical in the case of both networks having the same hashing power.

Litecoin Technical Details:
The transaction confirmation time taken for Litecoin is about 2.5 minutes on average (as compared to Bitcoin's 10 minutes). The Litecoin network is scheduled to cap at 84 million currency units. 

Litecoin has inspired many other popular alternative currencies (eg. Dogecoin) because of its Scrypt hashing algorithm in order to prevent ASIC miners from mining those coins. However it is said that by the end of this year, Scrypt ASIC will enter the mass market.","2011-10-08","83.33","infrastructure","unknown","64.7","41.14890226073556","99.64354456532695","20.0","2447","5233","64.99439059786444","0"

In brief, Polkadot is a scalable heterogeneous multi-chain technology.

Polkadot is heterogeneous because it is entirely flexible and makes no assumption about the nature or structure of the chains in the network. Even non-blockchain systems or data structures can become parachains if they fulfill a set of criteria.

Polkadot may be considered equivalent to a set of independent chains (e.g. a set containing Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Namecoin and Bitcoin) except with important additions: pooled security and trust-free interchain transactability.

Many of the native parachains of Polkadot will be written using a Polkadot Runtime Environment SDK (e.g. Parity Technologies' Substrate).","","75.0","smart contract platform","ethereum","94.89999999999999","38.93350683750501","0.0","47.5","876","0","23.66295","0"

PAXG gives customers the benefits of actual physical ownership of specific gold bars with the speed and mobility of a digital asset. Customers are able to have fractional ownership of physical bars. On the Paxos platform, customers can convert their tokens to allocated gold, unallocated gold, or fiat currency (and vice versa) quickly and efficiently, reducing their exposure to settlement risk. PAXG is also available for trading on Paxos’ itBit exchange. PAXG will also be available on other crypto-asset exchanges, wallets, lending platforms and elsewhere within the crypto ecosystem.

BGB is a decentralised token that is the primary token of Morph's blockchain, serving as the gas, governance, and payment token across the layer. 

Who Are the Founders of Bitget Token?
Launched in 2021, Bitget Token (BGB) was initially positioned as the platform token for the Bitget exchange and Bitget Wallet. 
Behind Bitget is a team of visionary early adopters dedicated to a blockchain-powered future. The leadership team is comprised of seasoned professionals with experience at global giants like Goldman Sachs, Facebook, and Binance, including CEO Gracy Chen, COO Vugar Usi Zade, and CLO Hon Ng.
In September 2025, Bitget agreed to a strategic partnership with the Morph chain. The Morph Foundation, a non-profit decentralized organization, is now solely responsible for the future development of BGB.

What Makes Bitget Token (BGB) Unique?
BGB is the gas and governance token of the Morph chain. At the same time, BGB will also get support from its partners, such as exchanges and wallets, serving as a key medium for Launchpool's new token mining, fee discounts, and more.

How Many Bitget Token (BGB) Coins Are There in Circulation?
The initial supply of Bitget Token (BGB) is fixed at 2 billion tokens. As of September 2025, the circulating supply of BGB is 699,992,035. The Morph Foundation will update the BGB burn mechanism, linking it to Morph network activity, until the total BGB supply is reduced to 100 million.

How Is the Bitget Token Network Secured?
Bitget Token (BGB) initially operates on Ethereum's blockchain using the ERC-20 standard and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus, making it compatible with any Ethereum wallet. 
Following the strategic partnership between Bitget and Morph, a growing number of BGB will be migrated to the Morph chain, as the gas and governance token. 

Where Can You Buy Bitget Token (BGB)?
Bitget Token (BGB) can be purchased directly on the Bitget exchange. BGB is also available for trading on MECX, Bitfinex, Uniswap, and BulbaSwap.","","","exchange-based tokens","ethereum","37.4","42.964144691540426","0.0","20.0","2027","0","16.8169","0"

The platform emerged from the merger of Astherus and APX Finance in late 2024, with APX token holders able to migrate their holdings to ASTER.

Aster addresses the gap between centralized and decentralized exchanges by enabling traders to maintain full control of their assets while accessing deep liquidity and CEX-grade trading tools. The platform supports trading of both cryptocurrency perpetuals and U.S. stocks with up to 100x leverage, all settled on-chain in crypto without requiring traditional financial infrastructure.

The platform offers two distinct trading modes to accommodate different user needs. Simple Mode provides one-click, MEV-resistant trading with up to 1001x leverage for beginners, while Pro Mode delivers a full order book with advanced features like automated grid trading and hidden orders that remain invisible until execution. 

Aster operates across BNB Chain, Ethereum, Solana, and Arbitrum without requiring bridging, with liquidity pooled across markets to support large trades with minimal slippage. A distinctive feature allows users to deposit yield-generating assets like asBNB or USDF as collateral, earning passive returns while trading, maximizing capital efficiency compared to platforms where collateral sits idle.

Aster received backing from YZi Labs (formerly Binance Labs), which holds a minority stake through a private fund managing over $10 billion on behalf of early Binance executives. Changpeng Zhao, founder of Binance, serves in an advisory role and has personally invested over $2.5 million worth of ASTER tokens. 

The ASTER token serves multiple functions including governance rights, staking rewards through liquidity provision, and earning incentives through the platform's points program for traders and liquidity providers.

This system launched in 2024 as a rebrand and upgrade of the older Maker Protocol. Sky Protocol’s main value lies in giving users a simple, secure way to trade, save, and earn rewards without ever giving up control of their funds. It is built around a stablecoin called USDS, which is always worth one US dollar, but it is completely decentralized.

The protocol is run by automated agreements called smart contracts, so there’s no middleman controlling users' money. The system uses two main tokens: USDS for stable savings, and SKY for community governance. users can help secure the network and earn rewards by staking their SKY tokens in the Staking Engine, which is like locking them in an interest-bearing account to help the system run. The protocol also uses SkyLink to seamlessly connect users' funds across different blockchains for faster and cheaper transactions.

The Sky Protocol is unique because it has no single CEO or traditional core team of investors; instead, it is managed entirely by its global community of SKY token holders. This decentralized setup means that SKY is primarily used for two core utilities: it grants essential voting power to decide on all major system changes, and it can be staked in the Staking Engine to help secure the network and earn rewards. Staking also provides holders with the ability to borrow the USDS stablecoin, making SKY the essential key for both governance and income generation within the ecosystem.","","100.0","decentralized finance (defi)","ethereum","35.6","49.38830308715236","0.0","20.0","1549","0","16.8091","0"

Pi Network is a social cryptocurrency, developer platform, and ecosystem designed for widespread accessibility and real-world utility. It enables users to mine and transact Pi using a mobile-friendly interface while supporting applications built within its blockchain ecosystem.

Supply Model and Mining Mechanism
The Maximum Supply of Pi is 100 billion tokens. The Maximum Supply is comprised of the following: 65 Billion tokens (or 65%) are allocated for all community mining rewards; 10 billion (10%) are allocated for foundation reserves; 5 billion (5%) are allocated for liquidity purposes; and 20 billion (20%) are allocated for the Core Team. Each allocation mentioned above tracks the community Migrated Mining Rewards issuance pace, so the proportions of each allocation in the total supply remains the same at any given time. 

The Effective Total Supply of Pi—the total Pi supply at the current time—allocates Pi proportionally the same as the Maximum Supply. Since every allocation tracks the Migrated Mining Rewards of the community, the Effective Total Supply can be calculated by dividing the current Migrated Mining Rewards of Pi on the Mainnet blockchain by 65%. The other allocations within the Effective Total Supply can then be calculated based on the same proportions as the Maximum Supply, e.g. at most 10% of the Effective Total Supply is available in the foundation reserve, 5% of the Effective Total Supply is available for liquidity purposes, and 20% of the Effective Total Supply is available for the Core Team. This remains true despite the fact that all tokens were minted at the genesis as technically required by the blockchain protocol.

Circulating Supply includes all Migrated Mining Rewards and all tokens that entered circulation from other buckets of the allocations, which at its maximum could be summed up to equal the Effective Total Supply. 

Pi’s mining rewards are distributed based on an issuance formula that follows a declining exponential model defined in the Pi whitepaper. Users can increase the amount of mining rewards they receive based on their individual contributions to the network, like Security Circles, using utility-based Pi apps, running Nodes, etc. For each month, the amount of Pi to be distributed as mobile balance is capped and determined by the model, regardless of how many people or how many types of mining rewards there are during the month. The capping is achieved by the design of a system-wide base mining rate, and each type of mining rewards to each individual are just a multiplier of this base mining rate. As the monthly supplies always diminish, the base mining rate generally decreases over time. 

Fewer Pi may also be issued because the real Pi issuance on the blockchain depends on Pioneers passing KYC and completing all steps required for migration to the Mainnet. Despite all efforts to facilitate and remind Pioneers to complete those required steps, there are always dropoffs along the way, resulting in less than all outstanding mobile balances to be issued on the blockchain. Because of this mechanism, the community issued amount (Migrated Mining Rewards) on the blockchain will likely be closer and closer to a line lower than the 65 billion. This is thus the reason for the variable Effective Total Supply which incorporates this effect. Effective Total Supply results from all Migrated Mining Rewards divided by 65%, as opposed to the Maximum Supply of 100 billion.

Ecosystem and Adoption
Pi Network has built an integrated ecosystem that facilitates real-world transactions and decentralized applications. Pi can be used as a medium of exchange for goods and services, including online commerce and local brick-and-mortar businesses.

Users can engage with Core Team and community-built apps in the Pi ecosystem through the Pi Browser, where integrated features like the Pi Wallet provide a seamless experience. Events like PiFest 2024 showcased Pi’s growing adoption, with over 27,000 active sellers and 28,000 test merchants across 160 countries.

Who Are the Founders of Pi Network?
Pi Network was founded by Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis and Dr. Chengdiao Fan, both of whom have PhDs from Stanford University and a passion for improving human lives through technology.

Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis is a Stanford PhD in EE and postdoc in CS with research on distributed systems and human-computer interaction. His work focuses on combining distributed systems and human computer interaction to bring cryptocurrency to everyday people. As a strong and long-term believer of the technical, financial and social potential of cryptocurrencies, he is determined to move them beyond their current limitations and is committed to bringing the power of blockchain to more people.

Dr. Chengdiao Fan holds a Stanford PhD in Anthropological Sciences, harnessing social computing to unlock human potential on a global scale. Chengdiao is building Pi Network to mobilize individuals all over the world to participate and be rewarded for their contributions, and establish an inclusive ecosystem for global citizens to unleash and capture their own agency, and in turn create utilities and productions for society and the world.

Compliance and Identity Verification
Pi Network follows a one-account-per-person policy through its Know Your Customer (KYC) solution. This system combines machine automation and human verification to authenticate user identities while preserving privacy.

The KYC process emphasizes real individuals, combats fraudulent activities and enables fair participation in the mining process of the network. Pi’s identity verification approach balances scalability, security, and accessibility, allowing millions of users worldwide to validate their accounts while maintaining regulatory compliance.","","78.49","layer 1 (l1)","unknown","48.9","44.8511559518422","99.21978860582392","20.0","5842","0","51.551776012038374","0"

What’s unique about KuCoin is that they share 50% of their overall trading fee revenue with users holding their exchange-based token. In a similar fashion to Binance, KuCoin offers relatively low tradings fees and incentives for holding (or trading) its native cryptocurrency. Back in 2011, the founders started researching blockchain tech and went further to build the technical architecture for KuCoin in 2013. 4 years later, the exchange launched with the ultimate goal of “becoming one of the top 10 worldwide hottest exchange platform[s]” by 2019.

As stated on their official website which lists 12 core members, “Kucoin aims at providing users digital asset transaction and exchange services which are even more safe and convenient, integrating premium assets worldwide, and constructing state of the art transaction platform”. CEO and founder, Michael Gam, is a former technical expert at Ant Financial, an affiliate company of the Chinese Alibaba Group. He was also a senior partner at Internet giants like MikeCRM and KF5.COM. OO, Eric Don, is referred to as a “senior Internet researcher, systems architect, and Internet industry star”. He is also stated to be the CTO and senior partner of IT companies including YOULIN.COM, KITEME, and REINOT. However, it’s unclear if these websites actually exist as they did not show in a Google search or when entering the website domains.  According to his LinkedIn, he is currently CTO at Youlin Network Technologies, yet there is no mention of KITEME or REINOT.

With its growing user base and increasing number of cryptocurrencies being offered, KuCoin may be set up for a strong run in the markets. KuCoin Shares volume is expected to grow as the daily trading volume on KuCoin, hence, trading fees collection grows &amp; thus, the size of dividend payout grows. This can lure investors to hold KCS token which may even increase its value. KuCoin faces stiff competition from OKEx, but it expects to continue to grow its community exponentially as it is being projected to be one among the top 5 exchanges in the world.

A key component of the Worldcoin project is the development of the foundational infrastructure that will be important for a world where AI plays an increasingly large role.

The Worldcoin system revolves around World ID, a privacy-preserving global identity network. World ID enables users to verify their humanness online while maintaining their privacy through zero-knowledge proofs.

Using World ID, individuals will be able to prove that they are a real, unique human to any platform that integrates with the protocol, including to web3 systems, social networking sites, and governmental programs. This will enable fair airdrops or token/NFT sales, provide protection against bots/sybil attacks on social media, and enable the fairer distribution of limited governmental resources. Furthermore, World ID can also enable global democratic processes and novel forms of governance (e.g., via quadratic voting), and it may eventually show a path to AI-funded UBI. The Worldcoin token (WLD), alongside World ID, will let users participate in governing the Worldcoin protocol. 

To engage with the Worldcoin protocol, individuals must first download a first wallet app that supports the creation of a World ID. Users visit a physical imaging device called the Orb to get their World ID Orb-verified. Orbs are operated by a network of independent local businesses called Orb Operators. The Orb uses multispectral sensors to verify humanness and uniqueness to issue an Orb-verified World ID, with all images being promptly deleted on-device per default (absent explicit consent to Data Custody). All Orb-verified World IDs holders are entitled to claim recurring grants of free WLD tokens, subject to certain availability restrictions. The WLD token is designed as a utility token with governance properties.

Some zones act as hubs with respect to other zones, allowing many zones to interoperate through a shared hub. The architecture uses classic BFT and Proof-of-Stake algorithms, instead of Proof-of-Work. Cosmos can interoperate with multiple other applications and cryptocurrencies, something other blockchains can’t do well. By creating a new zone, you can plug any blockchain system into the Cosmos hub and pass tokens back and forth between those zones, without the need for an intermediary.

While the Cosmos Hub is a multi-asset distributed ledger, there is a special native token called the atom. ATOM have three use cases: as a spam-prevention mechanism, as staking tokens, and as a voting mechanism in governance.

As a spam prevention mechanism, ATOM are used to pay fees. The fee may be proportional to the amount of computation required by the transaction, similar to Ethereum’s concept of “gas”. Fee distribution is done in-protocol and a protocol specification is described here.

As staking tokens, ATOM can be “bonded” in order to earn block rewards. The economic security of the Cosmos Hub is a function of the amount of ATOM staked. The more ATOM that are collateralized, the more “skin” there is at stake and the higher the cost of attacking the network. Thus, the more ATOM there are bonded, the greater the economic security of the network.

Atom holders may govern the Cosmos Hub by voting on proposals with their staked ATOM.","","90.0","smart contract platform","cosmos","92.30000000000001","45.66428706348805","98.80631246350315","41.4","1631","0","56.74235936222609","0"

Kaspa aims to be the world's global sequencer for traditional finance and decentralized crypto markets by utilizing proof-of-work and its BlockDAG consensus protocol, GHOSTDAG.
Being the world's fastest proof-of-work network, Kaspa combines five properties: (1) hard money principles, (2) Bitcoin's ethos of security-first fundamentals (boasting a security threshold of fifty percent with significant market hashrate), (3) decentralization from rapid block rate mining, (4) block speeds faster than any PoW or PoS network, and (5) smart contract development through based-rollups without fragmented liquidity. Ushering in all five properties, Kaspa is on track to fulfill Satoshi Nakamoto's vision of a digital medium of exchange while also advancing global layer-one sequencing and minuscule confirmation times dominated by internet latency (cf. chapter 6 of the the paper for some initial benchmarks). The Kaspa implementation includes a lot of cool features and subprotocols including Reachability to query the DAG's topology, Block data pruning (with near-future plans for block header pruning), SPV proofs, and later subnetwork support which will make future implementation of layer 2 solutions much easier.","","89.47","smart contract platform","unknown","98.4","43.48756819042615","97.82594072822117","57.3","1350","0","60.369579254877415","0"

## What is Flare (FLR)?

Flare is an EVM-based Layer 1 blockchain designed to allow developers to build applications that are interoperable with blockchains and the internet. By providing decentralized access to high-integrity data, Flare enables new use cases and monetisation models.


## What makes Flare unique?

Flare's native interoperability protocols, the State Connector and the FTSO are secured by the network itself, allowing it to reliably deliver data from a wide variety of off-chain sources in a decentralized way. 

The Flare Time Series Oracle delivers highly-decentralized price and data feeds to dapps on Flare, without relying on centralized providers. 

The State Connector protocols enable information, both from other blockchains and the internet to be used securely, scalably and trustlessly with smart contracts on Flare.

Risk is minimized by building this decentralized data infrastructure natively into the blockchain, powered by a large number of independent data providers.

By incentivizing sets of independent providers to query, acquire, and process data without relying on single, centralized sources, Flare’s core protocols can facilitate the development of interoperable dapps with a broad range of potential innovative use cases.


## What is the Flare (FLR) token used for?

FLR is the native token used for payments, transaction fees to prevent spam attacks and staking in validator nodes. FLR can also be wrapped into an ERC-20 variant, WFLR. WFLR tokens serve various functions; they can be delegated to FTSO data providers, for example, or staked to participate in governance. These two uses are not mutually exclusive and do not prevent the tokens from being used in other EVM-compatible dapps and smart contracts on Flare.

Wrapped FLR (WFLR) can be minted by depositing native FLR tokens into a smart contract and withdrawing the newly minted","","100.0","smart contract platform","unknown","83.5","46.828558634889","0.0","52.300000000000004","2024","0","24.89175","0"

In 2024, the VeChain Renaissance upgrade was launched, introducing Ethereum compatibility, dPoS consensus, and dynamic gas fees. It cut VTHO inflation and introduced StarGate NFT staking, where users lock VET to mint transferable NFTs that earn VTHO, can be delegated to validators, and serve as governance instruments. The upgrade also added new eco node tiers, lowering entry barriers while keeping rewards across higher staking levels.

The significant majority of this portfolio is held in the iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ: SHV). There is also a small portion of USDC and USD for liquidity purposes.
OUSG brings exposure to the ‘risk-free’ US Treasury rate on-chain for the first time. OUSG is an investment option that delivers a stable and predictable return while offering deep liquidity. Ondo funds such as OUSG only ever invest into ETFs backed by secure, stable, and liquid securities; these are the same assets in which trillions of dollars are invested every day by the world's largest institutions.
OUSG was developed alongside two other fund tokens, OSTB and OHYG, by Ondo Finance, a software development firm in DeFi. Ondo launched in August 2021. Its first product was Ondo Vaults, a structured finance protocol on Ethereum. Later that year, Ondo launched Liquidity-as-a-Service (LaaS), facilitating over $210M in total liquidity provided.

As DeFi yields compressed in 2022, the Ondo team decided to sunset Vaults and LaaS (together, ""Ondo V1"") to focus on next-generation protocols. Ondo V2, including Ondo’s tokenized funds, were announced by Nathan Allman in January 2023. Ondo funds subsequently opened to subscriptions soon after. 

What can OUSG be Used For?
For investors who pass KYC and AML screening and sign subscription documents, OUSG tokens represent ownership in the fund. Investors can transfer these tokens between each other to effect changes in fund ownership. Investors can also use smart contracts to facilitate their financial arrangements such as by engaging in lending and trading activities with each other. 

The tokens themselves have transfer restrictions that will ensure they do not end up in the hands of anyone not appropriately qualified as an investor in the fund.","","100.0","tokenized assets","ethereum","2.0","50.08972849155639","0.0","20.0","1928","0","16.814500000000002","0"

Created by an anonymous team of 22 Solana developers and builders, Bonk distributed 50% of its total 100 trillion token supply via airdrop to community members including NFT collectors, developers, and artists. 

The project positions itself as ""the first Solana dog coin for the people, by the people,"" explicitly rejecting venture capital backing in favor of grassroots community ownership. What sets Bonk apart from other memecoins is its combination of fair launch mechanics, extensive ecosystem integration, and active deflationary strategy. 

Built on Solana, BONK benefits from fast transaction speeds and low fees that make it practical for everyday use. Native products include LetsBonk.fun (a memecoin launchpad that briefly became Solana's market leader in 2025, surpassing Pump.fun with over 78% market share), BonkSwap (a decentralized exchange) and BonkBot (a Telegram trading bot with built-in burn mechanics). 

BONK is available across 10 blockchain networks and listed on major exchanges including Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, and Robinhood. Governance is handled by BonkDAO, which holds 15% of the token supply and makes decisions through on-chain voting. 

The community has organized several major burn events, most notably the December 2024 BURNmas campaign that destroyed 1.69 trillion tokens worth over $50 million. In September 2025, Nasdaq-listed Safety Shot, Inc. formed BONK Holdings LLC and acquired over 2.5% of the circulating supply (valued at $55-63 million), making BONK one of the first memecoins to attract formal corporate treasury adoption. Core contributor Nom was appointed to Safety Shot's board, and the company holds a 10% revenue share in LetsBonk.fun.

As with all memecoins, BONK is a highly speculative asset with substantial volatility. Its value is primarily driven by community sentiment, social media momentum, and meme culture rather than traditional utility. 

The anonymous team, while common in the memecoin space, means investors should exercise appropriate caution. Despite these risks, Bonk has established itself as one of the most successful community-driven tokens in the Solana ecosystem, approaching 1 million unique holders and expanding from a simple memecoin into meaningful DeFi infrastructure.

Tezos is a high-performing blockchain and open-source platform for assets and applications, with a strong focus on code security, on-chain governance, and decentralization. Tezos 2.0, the upcoming step in the evolution of Tezos, aims to improve scalability (via layer 2s), composability, and to implement support to mainstream programming languages (like Javascript, Typescript, Python, and many others).


Initially built with formal verification in mind, the Tezos protocol enables builders to avoid bugs when developing smart contracts, making it particularly suited to applications that require a high degree of security and certainty.


Tezos’ LPoS (Liquid Proof-of-Stake) consensus mechanism enables any stakeholder to take part, directly or by delegation, in the consensus process, and to be rewarded for securing the network. Rather uniquely, Tezos’ on-chain governance system also enables stakeholders to create and vote on protocol upgrade proposals. This pioneering system allows the protocol to self-amend and upgrade itself without leading to a split (or fork) in the blockchain, empowering the community without slowing down innovation.


First proposed in 2014 and launched in 2018, the Tezos Mainnet has a proven track record of running uninterrupted ever since, having earned a strong reputation for technical excellence and a supportive community. 


Who Are the Founders of Tezos?
Tezos was conceived by Arthur and Kathleen Breitman in a 2014 white paper under the pseudonym L.M. Goodman in a nod to Satoshi Nakamoto, referencing a journalist who had misidentified the creator of Bitcoin.


In a previous paper, the Breitmans had argued that Bitcoin's biggest shortcomings were the lack of a governance process that invited contributions from its community of users, cost and centralization issues raised by its proof-of-work system, the limited expressiveness of its programming language which didn’t allow for smart contracts, and security ","","100.0","smart contract platform","unknown","32.7","45.46805405650512","0.0","20.0","2003","0","16.816","0"

tBTC allows you to unlock your Bitcoin’s value to borrow and lend, mint stablecoins, provide liquidity, and much more.

tBTC is a decentralized wrapped Bitcoin that is 1:1 backed by main-net BTC. Existing solutions bringing Bitcoin to Ethereum require you to send your Bitcoin to an intermediary, who then issues you an Ethereum token representing your original asset. 

This centralized model requires you to trust a third party and is prone to censorship, sacrificing Bitcoin's promise of secure, permissionless decentralization.

How does tBTC solve this issue?
Instead of centralized intermediaries, tBTC uses a randomly selected group of operators running nodes on the Threshold Network to secure deposited Bitcoin through threshold cryptography. 

That means tBTC requires a threshold majority agreement before operators perform any action with your Bitcoin. By rotating the selection of operators weekly, tBTC protects against any individual or group of operators colluding to fraudulently seize the underlying deposits. 

By relying on an honest-majority-assumption, we can calculate the likelihood any wallet comprised of a quorum of dishonest operators. An insurance backstop (the coverage pools), serves as an emergency fallback in the event a wallet is compromised.

What is Threshold Network?
Threshold.network stems from the merger of NuCypher and Keep networks into a single decentralized network — it delivers a suite of threshold cryptography services for web3 applications through a decentralized network of staking nodes. The whole community is governed by a DAO.

Flagship services of Threshold Network include Threshold Access Control (TACo) – which enables end-to-end encrypted data sharing and communication without the need to trust a centralized authority, tBTC v2 - the only decentralized and permissionless Bitcoin-to-Ethereum asset bridge and thUSD - an overcollateralized and decentralized USD stablecoin that uses both ETH and tBTC as collateral.","","","crypto-backed tokens","ethereum","90.0","42.74079371183735","94.80664566238067","49.5","2007","0","57.37347598183323","0"

FTN is the native coin of Bahamut - public, layer 1 EVM-based blockchain solution with a novelty consensus - PoSA. PoSA stands for Proof of Stake and Activity, where Activity is represented by the amount of gas spent by users when interacting with a validator-deployed smart contract. The more gas usage the given smart contract has, the more chances for the validator-deployer to become a block producer in future epochs.

What makes Bahamut unique?
The main unique aspect of Bahamut is the PoSA consensus, which introduces new ways for businesses to monetize their user base, while preserving the integrity and transparency of the web3 space. 

History of Fasttoken (FTN):
FTN was originally an ERC20 token of SoftConstruct and Fastex ecosystems. After Bahamut mainnet launched on May 3, 2023 with FTN as its native coin, the migration process started from Ethereum to Bahamut and is still an ongoing process. 

What’s next for Bahamut?
The infrastructure of Bahamut is constantly growing - users can expect decentralized exchanges, various apps, bridge services, and other essential aspects to be available on Bahamut before the end of the year. Also, Bahamut grant program is under way and will open the doors to everyone who wants to build a better decentralized future together.

What can Fasttoken (FTN) be used for?
FTN is used in a variety of providers as a gaming token, and also the native coin for Bahamut network.

Initially built on Ethereum's Base Layer 2 network, the protocol has expanded to Ethereum mainnet, Solana, and Ronin as of 2025. VIRTUAL serves as the base liquidity pair and transactional currency for all AI agent interactions across the ecosystem.

The protocol operates through a bonding curve system where new AI agents are created with a 100 VIRTUAL fee. Users can buy and sell agent tokens until the agent reaches 42,000 VIRTUAL, at which point it graduates to a permanent liquidity pool paired with VIRTUAL. AI agents are multimodal, capable of text, speech, and 3D animation, and can manage on-chain wallets autonomously. Notable examples include Luna, an AI girl band vocalist with over 500,000 TikTok followers. The GAME framework powers agent functionality, enabling them to process inputs, generate responses, and remember past interactions.

Virtuals Protocol was founded by Jansen Teng and Weekee Tiew, evolving from PathDAO, a gaming guild established in 2021 that pivoted to AI agents in January 2024. The team raised $16 million in seed funding led by DeFiance Capital and Beam. In 2025, major partnerships were announced with Animoca Brands and a collaboration with Zyfai and BasisOS to launch an Agentic Fund of Funds.

Users can stake VIRTUAL tokens for veVIRTUAL to participate in DAO governance and may receive airdrops of agent tokens. When users interact with agents, they pay fees in VIRTUAL that generate protocol revenue. This revenue funds periodic buybacks and burns of the VIRTUAL token, reducing its total supply as a value-accrual mechanism for holders.","","71.43","artificial intelligence (ai)","ethereum","89.1","40.432816013275456","0.0","60.5","1804","0","26.937549999999998","0"

For example, one of the biggest pools is 3CRV, which is a stablecoin pool consisting of DAI, USDT, and USDC. Their ratio in the pool will be based on the supply and demand of the market. Depositing a coin with a lesser ratio will yield the user a higher percentage of the pool. As such when the ratio is heavily tilted to one of the coins, it may serve as a good chance to arbitrage.

Curve Finance also supports yield-bearing tokens. For example, it collaborated with Yearn Finance to release yUSD pools that consisted of yDAI, yUSDT, yUSDC and yTUSD. Users that participated in this pool will not only have yield from the underlying yield-bearing tokens, but also the swap fees generated by the Curve pool. Including the yield farming rewards in terms of CRV tokens, liquidity providers of the pool actually have three sources of yield. ","","100.0","decentralized exchange (dex)","ethereum","97.7","39.348379853141545","98.5573466384525","57.099999999999994","1208","0","60.57227132345838","0"

Kinesis gold (KAU) is a gold-backed cryptocurrency, launched by Kinesis - a global trading and digital asset utility platform. Each Kinesis gold (KAU) token is backed by 1 gram of investment-grade gold bullion, securely stored in Kinesis’ fully insured, audited vaults.
The mission behind KAU is to reintroduce physical gold backing to money and provide the global community with a stable store of value. Kinesis gold (KAU) has the everyday utility of a fiat currency; the borderless efficiency of a cryptocurrency, and none of the inherent volatility. 
KAU enables physical gold bullion to be instantly purchased, traded, spent and sent anywhere in the world, bringing real-world access, value, and utility to physical precious metals. A true stablecoin, KAU allows crypto traders to easily exit volatile markets and enter into the enduring value of physical gold, while earning a monthly yield.

What makes KAU unique?
In an economic first, KAU holders earned the first debt-free yield on precious metals. All KAU holders receive a passive yield - paid monthly in KAU - simply for holding their metals on the Kinesis platform. The yield is calculated from a 15% share of Kinesis’ global transaction fee revenue which is shared with users who store their gold on the platform. At the time of writing, Kinesis has paid out over $3,000,000 to KAU holders. 

Unlike other gold tokens, KAU can be instantly spent with the Kinesis Virtual Card, worldwide. Accessible via mobile device, the virtual card lets people everywhere instantly convert their KAU holdings into local currency at the point of sale, anywhere Mastercard is accepted. Through digitalising physical gold in the form of KAU, Kinesis has successfully reintroduced gold as a currency.

Can I redeem my gold?

Kinesis silver (KAG) is a silver-backed cryptocurrency, launched by Kinesis - a global trading and digital asset utility platform. Each Kinesis silver (KAG) token is backed by 1 ounce of investment-grade silver bullion, securely stored in Kinesis’ fully insured, audited vaults.
The mission behind KAG is to reintroduce physical silver backing to money and provide the global community with a stable store of value. Kinesis silver (KAG) has the everyday utility of a fiat currency; the borderless efficiency of a cryptocurrency, and none of the inherent volatility.
KAG enables physical silver bullion to be instantly purchased, traded, spent and sent anywhere in the world, bringing real-world access, value, and utility to physical precious metals. A true stablecoin, KAG allows crypto traders to easily exit volatile markets and enter into the enduring value of physical silver, while earning a monthly yield.
What makes KAG unique?
In an economic first, KAG holders earned the first debt-free yield on precious metals. All KAG holders receive a passive yield - paid monthly in KAG - simply for holding their metals on the Kinesis platform. The yield is calculated from a 15% share of Kinesis’ global transaction fee revenue which is shared with users who store their silver on the platform.
Unlike other silver tokens, KAG can be instantly spent with the Kinesis Virtual Card, worldwide. Accessible via mobile device, the virtual card lets people everywhere instantly convert their KAG holdings into local currency at the point of sale, anywhere Mastercard is accepted. Through digitalising physical gold in the form of KAG, Kinesis has successfully reintroduced silver as a currency.
Can I redeem my silver?
Every single ounce of silver underpinning KAG is available for redemption, at the click of a button. While other silver-backed cryptos offer redemption, they often set very high minimum withdrawal limits, making redemption unfeasible for everyday investors.","","66.67","stablecoins","unknown","73.8","51.71004082758918","49.22520352448604","49.7","2008","0","41.47012123357012","0"

The first ledger with microtransactions without fees as well as secure data transfer. Quantum proof. IOTA is a ground breaking new open-source distributed ledger that does not use a blockchain. Its innovative new quantum-proof protocol, known as the Tangle, gives rise to unique new features like zero fees, infinite scalability, fast transactions, secure data transfer and many others. IOTA is initially focused on serving as the backbone of the Internet-of-Things (IoT).

IOTA is a cryptocurrency that has no transaction fees and requires no miners in order to process transactions. It does, however, require some computational power to submit a transaction, making it perfect for machines to use as a currency and distributed communication protocol for the Internet of Things “IoT”. The main purpose of IOTA is to solve some of the major problems with Blockchain technology, the main one being that the bigger the Blockchain (such as Bitcoin), the slower, more expensive, and also more restricting it is to actually transfer funds. Another issue with the Blockchain is size, as more and more Blocks are added, the longer the Blockchain gets, and therefore the less amount of computers are able to mine it. Right now BTC is over 150GB long, and so is ETH. If this size increased tenfold, very few computers would be able to mine it at all. Making them relatively centralized (the top 2 Bitcoin mining pools own about 56% of hashing power).

The goal of Bitcoin SV is to fulfil the original vision of the Bitcoin protocol and design as described in Satoshi Nakamoto’s white paper, early Bitcoin client software and known Satoshi writings. BSV aims to offer scalability and stability in line with the original description of Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, as well as deliver a distributed data network that can support enterprise-level advanced blockchain applications. To this end, it has removed artificial block size limits and re-enabled Script commands and other technical capabilities which had been historically disabled or restricted by the protocol developers of the BTC blockchain. This allows the network to process tens of thousands of transactions per second while maintaining extremely low transaction fees for micropayments, in addition to offering advanced capabilities such as tokens, smart contracts, computation and other data use cases. The BSV network is unique in its capacity for unbounded on-chain scaling while also being more aligned with the original design of Bitcoin than any other blockchain.","","0.0","smart contract platform","unknown","41.6","41.86872044106627","98.2466016832706","20.0","1256","0","51.190085589144715","0"

ENS’s job is to map human-readable names like ‘alice.eth’ to machine-readable identifiers such as Ethereum addresses, other cryptocurrency addresses, content hashes, and metadata. ENS also supports ‘reverse resolution’, making it possible to associate metadata such as canonical names or interface descriptions with Ethereum addresses.

ENS has similar goals to DNS, the Internet’s Domain Name Service, but has significantly different architecture due to the capabilities and constraints provided by the Ethereum blockchain. Like DNS, ENS operates on a system of dot-separated hierarchical names called domains, with the owner of a domain having full control over subdomains.

Top-level domains, like ‘.eth’ and ‘.test’, are owned by smart contracts called registrars, which specify rules governing the allocation of their subdomains. Anyone may, by following the rules imposed by these registrar contracts, obtain ownership of a domain for their own use. ENS also supports importing in DNS names already owned by the user for use on ENS.

Because of the hierarchal nature of ENS, anyone who owns a domain at any level may configure subdomains - for themselves or others - as desired. For instance, if Alice owns 'alice.eth', she can create 'pay.alice.eth' and configure it as she wishes.

cUSD is a digital dollar issued on the Ethereum blockchain that can be used on any network. cUSD's reserve is backed by blue chip stablecoins such as USDC, USDT, pyUSD, BUIDL, and BENJI, i.e. issued by regulated institutions with transparent attestations. It is 1:1 redeemable for any of the available reserve assets.

stcUSD is a savings product issued by staking cUSD. Any cUSD holder has open access to stcUSD. Yield is generated via an autonomous layer of operators, who self-select in and out based on the current hurdle rate of the protocol. The risk of yield generation is covered, meaning users have full downside protection that is verifiable by code.","","","liquid staking tokens","ethereum","29.799999999999997","50.83403055142783","0.0","45.1","814","0","23.05875","0"

Through the Sentient GRID, 100+ partners collaborate across agents, models, data, and compute to create a decentralized alternative to closed AGI labs. 

Sentient addresses the most urgent risk of our time: closed-source AGI.
Today, a handful of corporations are building AGI in secret, deciding what it knows, how it thinks, and who it serves. AGI is the most powerful technology humanity has ever created. If controlled by a few, it could lock the future into their hands, creating a fundamental threat to society.

Sentient’s mission is to ensure AGI is open, community-built, and not controlled by a single entity. We are achieving this through THE GRID: the world’s largest open network of intelligence. The GRID is the first real step toward open-source AGI: a decentralized fabric of specialized agents, models, datasets, tools, and compute—contributed by the world’s best builders—working together as one to deliver high-quality results.

What is NEO?
NEO uses a smart economy approach to implement its distributed network concept. Its main objective is to digitize assets using the decentralized network of blockchain technology and digital identity.

Neo’s main aim is to be the distributed network for “smart economy”.  As their website states: ""Digital Assets + Digital Identity + Smart Contract = Smart Economy."" Neo was developed by Shanghai-based blockchain R&amp;D company “OnChain” and funded by two crowdsales: first crowdsale on October 2015 sold 17.5 million NEO tokens for $550,000 and the second crowdsale sold the remaining 22.5 million NEO tokens for $4.5 million.

So why NEO?
Asset digitization and identity on the NEO platform essentially creates a novel way for asset registration, issuance, and circulation. This means that tangible assets like real estate, company shares or even fiat money can be digitized and traded on the NEO network, thus giving rise to a whole new economy.

Its digital identity system allows for integration between the platform and the real world economy. It has custom digital identity standards that enable the creation of electronic identity data for individuals, organizations and even entities. These electronic systems use multi-layered authentication models that include facial and voice recognition as well as fingerprints.

All digital assets on the platform enjoy legal protection thanks to the use of digital certificates on its public blockchain. This, in turn, guarantees trust as the system offers an indelible and unalterable record of all entities’ holdings.","2016-10-17","50.0","smart contract platform","unknown","45.7","43.893649603300915","99.47316200197918","20.0","1775","3397","64.57785670069272","0"

It can be viewed as a ""dual network"" consisting of two complementary subsystems, the Theta Edge Network and the Theta Blockchain. The edge network provides vast amounts of GPU compute power for AI, video, rendering and other tasks, while the Theta blockchain provides payment, reward, and smart contract capabilities. Below we provide more details for the two components.

Theta's Edge Network is a decentralized network consisting of over 10,000 active global nodes with 80 PetaFLOPS of always available distributed GPU compute power, equivalent to 250 Nvidia A100s. Theta Edge Network powers the Theta EdgeCloud, a leading hybrid cloud-edge AI computing platform launched on May 1, 2024. Leveraging Theta's recently approved patent on ‘Edge Computing Platform supported by Smart Contract Enabled Blockchain Network’ and the upcoming release of Elite+ Booster edge nodes, all Theta community members will be able to participate and share in the rewards from EdgeCloud AI, video, 3D rendering and gaming compute jobs. While chatbots like ChatGPT and others utilize GPUs, new generative AI models such as text-to-video, text-to-3D and sketch-to-3D will require 10-100x the amount of computational power. The combined GPU compute power of Theta's decentralized edge network and its preferred cloud partners is 20-30x more than other comparable networks in the industry today, holding the keys to global GPU compute, arguably the most valuable and most disruptive asset in history.

Theta blockchain is an EVM compatible multi-blockchain network which supports Turing complete smart contracts. This EVM support enables a wide range of interesting Web3 applications to be built on the Theta Network. Examples include non-fungible tokens (NFT), decentralized exchanges (DEX/DeFi), and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO), which could become indispensable building blocks of the next generation AI, media and entertainment platforms. Theta’s enterprise validator and governance council is led by Google, Samsung, Sony, Creative Artists Agency (CAA), Binance, Blockchain Ventures, DHVC, gumi and other global leaders. Theta has partnered with leading entertainment brands including Lionsgate, MGM, Katy Perry, American Idol, The Price is Right, Taste of Home, and more. Popular platforms utilizing Theta’s Web3 infrastructure include MetaCannes Film3 Festival, FuseTV, CONtv Anime, WPT, PetCollective, FailArmy, and other OTT streaming services. Strategic corporate investors include Samsung NEXT, Sony Innovation Fund, Bertelsmann Digital Media Investments (BDMI), CAA and Silicon Valley VCs including DCM and Sierra Ventures.","2017-12-14","100.0","artificial intelligence (ai)","unknown","93.2","40.661813809988956","96.8189401117852","61.5","2734","2974","73.33182903912481","0"

Golem Network is an open-source, decentralized computing platform that is building an ecosystem to provide computing power to the AI industry. A peer-to-peer marketplace for distributed computing resources. Users engage directly on the Golem platform, exchanging GLM tokens for the utilization of their idle computing resources.

Golem allows to break down tasks into smaller subtasks and distribute them across multiple providers, enabling parallel processing. This approach boosts efficiency and speeds up the completion of complex computations.

What is GLM?

GLM or Golem Network Token is needed to pay for computations on the network and is the currency that drives the marketplace. As a Requestor, you set a bid for an amount of GLM you are willing to pay to have your task completed. As a Provider, you earn GLM by computing tasks for Requestors.

How can I get involved?

If you want to stay up to date with the latest developments and updates, join the Golem Network Discord community here: https://chat.golem.network/

On Discord you can also find support to become a Provider or a Requestor in the Golem platform.","","","artificial intelligence (ai)","ethereum","65.4","46.10284559456834","72.94554163568084","43.2","1162","0","48.1311145724883","0"

BC III DLVF’s core business strategy is to leverage the proprietary resources and experience of BC Manager with the objective of generating growth and income from its investments. BC III DLVF holdings will primarily consist of new and growing blockchain technology and cryptocurrency businesses and ICOs.

Blockchain Capital continues to be focused on the nexus of the industry where blockchain-based innovations are augmenting and replacing legacy systems and infrastructure. As one of the earliest and most active investors in the blockchain industry, Blockchain Capital has valuable access to information, robust access to proprietary dealflow, and an extensive network that helps guide strategic investment opportunities.

In three broad categories, Blockchain Capital’s portfolios include companies that are facilitating the growth of the Bitcoin ecosystem, companies that are providing blockchain-based technology solutions to financial institutions and companies that are enabling non-financial institutions to leverage blockchain technology. The firm sees opportunity to add efficiency and enable new opportunities across each of these major categories.

As with any nascent technology, it remains to be seen exactly where blockchain technology will have its biggest impact. As such, Blockchain Capital takes a diversified approach to its portfolio by investing in a wide-range of use cases and applications—often beginning at the seed level. This diversified, early-stage strategy allows the firm to continue investing into successful portfolio companies in subsequent investment rounds while reducing portfolio exposure to less-successful companies and helping them find strategic alternatives.

The platform delivers high performance without compromising on security or decentralization, creating the infrastructure needed for complex applications that require high-frequency activity.

One of Monad’s key innovations lies in how it handles transaction processing. Instead of processing transactions one at a time like traditional blockchains, Monad processes multiple transactions simultaneously through parallel execution. 

The system separates the agreement process from the execution process, allowing validators to first agree on which transactions to include and in what order, then having more time to execute those transactions without slowing down consensus. This approach, combined with a custom-built database called MonadDB, dramatically increases throughput while maintaining accuracy.

Monad also offers complete EVM compatibility, where applications built for Ethereum work on Monad without any code modifications, and users can connect with familiar wallets like MetaMask just as they would on Ethereum. Developers can immediately tap into Ethereum's established ecosystem of tools, libraries, and applications while benefitting from Monad’s performance improvements. The platform also runs on consumer-grade hardware rather than expensive specialized equipment, making it accessible for more people to participate in securing the network.

Monad has raised approximately 244 million dollars in total funding across multiple rounds. The company secured 19 million dollars in a seed round in February 2023 led by Dragonfly Capital, followed by a 225 million dollar Series A round in April 2024 led by Paradigm at a 3 billion dollar valuation. Other notable investors include Electric Capital, Greenoaks, Coinbase Ventures, and prominent angel investors such as Naval Ravikant.","","71.43","smart contract platform","unknown","89.60000000000001","36.03648872483326","0.0","79.9","1919","0","31.788674999999998","0"

The protocol accepts liquid assets, including digital tokens and tokenized real world assets, to be deposited as collateral for issuing USDf, an overcollateralized synthetic dollar. USDf provides users with stable and accessible onchain liquidity without requiring the liquidation of their holdings.

To complement this, users can stake USDf to mint sUSDf, a yield-bearing token that is powered by diversified institutional-grade trading strategies. These strategies extend beyond traditional basis spread arbitrage and are designed to deliver performance across all market conditions.

By bridging the gap between traditional finance and decentralized finance, Falcon Finance offers institutions, protocols, and individuals a transparent and secure way to unlock the full potential of their assets. The platform combines innovation, yield generation, and robust risk management into a scalable infrastructure that redefines how collateral, liquidity, and asset ownership interact across financial domains.

$FF is the native token that captures the growth of Falcon Finance. As more assets are deposited and USDf adoption expands, $FF becomes the core asset tied to the protocol’s scale and success.

Falcon is building infrastructure designed for trillions in assets. $FF is the way to get exposure to that future.","","","decentralized exchange (dex)","ethereum","75.3","43.53356609589421","0.0","50.7","1474","0","24.4823","0"

The introduction of $cmETH, a permissionless, composable liquid restaking token that unlocks restaking opportunities on Mantle, and $COOK, the protocol's upcoming governance token, mETH Protocol enters its next phase with further enhanced offerings. Through these features, mETH Protocol provides its users with capital efficiency, convenience, and a wide range of yield-bearing opportunities within Mantle Ecosystem dApps, all in a design that has been created to maximize security with non-custodial core smart contracts and off-chain services that enforce sanity bounds and risk limits.","","","ethereum ecosystem","ethereum","87.9","36.88364812655079","0.0","86.2","1537","0","33.35895","0"

Basic Attention Token held an initial coin offering on May 31, 2017 for its eponymous ERC-20 utility token, raising approximately $35M USD at the time in less than 30 seconds. The Basic Attention Token aims to fix digital advertising, which is broken, fraudulent and opaque. 

Basic Attention Token work by having advertisers pay BAT to website publishers for the attention of users. The BAT token is designed to correctly value and price user attention within the platform. The Basic Attention Token comprises various components, including attention measurement systems, analytics dashboards and machine learning algorithms. Integration of BAT into a given host application involves implementing BAT Ads, a system that matches and displays ads to users based on locally stored data. Ad targeting is performed wholly on-device, removing the need for third-party tracking. BAT is focused on the Brave browser. Brave is an open-source, privacy-centered browser designed to block trackers and malware. It utilizes blockchain technology to anonymously and securely track user attention, which translates into rewards for publishers.

A user's attention, meaning his or her focused mental engagement on digital content like advertisements, is logged through Brave. The makers of BAT indicate that the user's private data and tracking information is stored only on the user's device, ensuring that it is anonymous and private.

Created back in 2016, the Basic Attention Token has one of the biggest names behind it, that of Brendan Eich, the creator of JavaScript and the legendary co-founder of Mozilla. Other noteworthy team members include Brian Bondy, lead developer and co-founder of Brave and Scott Locklin, senior engineer, and co-founder of Kerf Software.""

This cryptocurrency is the brainchild of Peter Waterland who realised that Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other such cryptocurrencies have no protection against future technology. It claims to be a “future-proof” cryptocurrency which enables transactions and decentralized communication while providing protection against classical as well as quantum computer attacks.

The Quantum Resistant Ledger company was founded by Peter Waterland, who found that Bitcoin, as well as Ethereum signatures are susceptible to attacks by powerful quantum computers. His research on quantum computers and signature programs let to the development of this new cryptocurrency, designed to be resistant to the present classical attacks as well as any future quantum computer attacks. Their team is made up of a diverse range of members spread out across the world, including developers (core, blockchain, mobile developers, etc.), analysts, advisors, marketing managers, designers and more.

Quantum Resistant Ledger is the first ever cryptocurrency and the only one in existence as of August 2018, to consider the threat that the future technology of quantum computing poses to cryptocurrencies and their working. It uses a technology specifically designed for post-quantum security, called XMSS, which makes it secure against powerful quantum computers even while using a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. Security against cyber-attacks is a very serious concern in this digital age, especially when you have digital assets whose loss is likely to lead you to bankruptcy.

QRL is the first blockchain technology that provides durability and stability through resistance to quantum computer attacks. The encryption methods used by modern blockchains can become vulnerable to quantum computers over the next ten years. QRL tries to create a blockchain with long-term stability. By using blockchain technology, the QRL platform creates a “ledger” that generates hashes in such a way that it is virtually impenetrable to any type of computer attack.","2018-06-26","41.67","smart contract platform","unknown","71.0","49.26515415241399","97.26128124309062","49.1","2172","2780","70.08424843508172","0"

This Nakamoto/Avalanche hybrid consensus integration gives it unique properties for a Bitcoin-like chain, such as instant transaction finality, staking rewards, extensibility through subnets, and flexible protocol governance.

The development roadmap is set with three main goals:
Scaling transaction throughput from ~100 tps to more than 5.000.000 tps
Improving the payment experience with a less than 3 second transaction finality time
Extending the protocol and establishing fork-free upgrades, allowing for more rapid, iterative development","","50.0","smart contract platform","unknown","77.10000000000001","41.82705117671668","0.0","68.89999999999999","888","0","29.013849999999998","0"

Convex allows Curve liquidity providers to earn trading fees and claim boosted CRV without locking CRV themselves. Liquidity providers can receive boosted CRV and liquidity mining rewards with minimal effort.
If you would like to stake CRV, Convex lets users receive trading fees as well as a share of boosted CRV received by liquidity providers. This allows for a better balance between liquidity providers and CRV stakers as well as better capital efficiency.

Curve liquidity providers can deposit their LP tokens into Convex to maximize their CRV earnings with a more efficient boost.

Curve DAO token stakers will be able to earn additional boosted CRV and CVX tokens through the protocol.

USR achieves its peg by hedging its collateral pool and maintaining a tokenized insurance fund called RLP. Users can stake USR to obtain the yield-bearing version called stUSR. USR is minted by depositing liquid assets, such as USDC or USDT, on 1:1 value basis. When USR is redeemed, a user receives a 1:1 equivalent to the notional amount.

RLP:
ETH portfolio backs USR with a more than 100% ratio. Excess part of collateral acts as a backing for RLP - Resolv Liquidity Pool. Key features of RLP:
RLP is designed to protect USR from market and counterparty risks. In exchange, RLP users receive higher portion of profits of the collateral pool.
RLP has a price, representing value of ETH backing a single unit of RLP token;
RLP price can vary. Collateral required for minting or redemption is based on the latest price;","","","lp tokens","ethereum","53.7","50.22394648718231","0.0","48.9","932","0","24.01565","0"

OriginTrail is an ecosystem building a trusted knowledge infrastructure for artificial intelligence (AI). It addresses the challenge of misinformation in the AI era by ensuring the origin of information and enabling discoverability of the world's most important knowledge and real-world assets (RWAs).
OriginTrail is creating a verifiable Internet for decentralized AI by empowering world-class brands and builders. It utilizes its unique Decentralized Knowledge Graph and  NeuroWeb blockchain to deliver AI-powered search and solutions for enterprises and individuals worldwide.
OriginTrail has gained support and partnerships with world-class organizations such as British Standards Institution, SCAN, Polkadot, Parity, Walmart, World Federation of Hemophilia, Oracle, the EU Commission's Next Generation Internet, and Microsoft Entrepreneurship for Positive Impact. These partnerships contribute to advancing OriginTrail's trusted knowledge foundation and its applicability in trillion-dollar industries, while providing a verifiable Internet of knowledge important in particular to drive the economies of RWAs.
The best way to see the technology in action is by checking ChatDKG,  an experimental, question-answering bot on X (Twitter) based on trusted Knowledge Assets in OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG). The ChatDKG provides answers based on OriginTrail trusted AI.
The Metcalfe phase of OriginTrail’s roadmap pursues an ambitious goal of creating the world’s largest verifiable Internet for AI, consisting of 100 billion Knowledge Assets, bringing a 100,000x scalability increase. As the name of the phase suggests, it seeks to produce network effects across the OriginTrail DKG and use novel techniques to pursue autonomous DKG growth based on the Genesis knowledge foundation being created by organizations and individuals alike. The Genesis part of the Metcalfe’s phase also introduces knowledge mining and knowledge signaling capabilities to drive constant growth of the verifiable Internet.
Following the Genesis stage and the transition to an AI-native V8, further capabilities will become available in the Convergence stage. By leveraging the advancements in AI and the DKG, we will unlock autonomous knowledge mining which in turn leads to an autonomous DKG. At that stage, new knowledge gets added to the DKG with very limited human involvement. Services such as AI agents will be performing knowledge inferencing directly on the DKG to find any “blind spots” in the knowledge they can fill as well as search for new knowledge and bring it to the DKG in accordance with knowledge signaling.

Who are the founders of OriginTrail?
The founders of OriginTrail, Žiga Drev, Tomaž Levak, and Branimir Rakić, established OriginTrail with a vision to build and implement a Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG)—an infrastructure designed to bring trusted knowledge sharing to enterprises and individuals across the globe. Their mission was to address the growing need for verifiable, transparent, and decentralized data in an increasingly complex digital world. This vision has led to adoption by major institutions, including the British Standards Institution (BSI), the Supplier Compliance Audit Network (SCAN), Swiss Federal Railways (SBB), World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH), and numerous EU and UK government-backed projects.
Guided by principles of neutrality, inclusiveness, and usability, the founders spearheaded partnerships with leading technology companies and initiated a grant program to minimize development risks and foster community growth within the OriginTrail ecosystem.
As part of their ongoing mission to tackle AI-era challenges—such as misinformation, deepfakes, and data manipulation—Trace Labs, the core developers behind OriginTrail, became a founding shareholder in Umanitek. Umanitek builds on the symbolic-AI foundation of the DKG to ensure information trust, defend data ownership, and uphold censorship-resistant digital infrastructure","2018-01-24","","artificial intelligence (ai)","ethereum","87.5","49.51140666683908","95.79341092135445","55.60000000000001","4030","2933","71.32634382247404","0"

MultiversX is a blockchain protocol that offers true horizontal scalability by using all aspects of sharding (Network, Transaction &amp; State). The project describes itself as a technology ecosystem for the new internet, which includes decentralized finance, real world assets and the Metaverse. Its smart contracts execution platform is reportedly capable of up to 100,000 transactions per second, 6-second latency and a $0.002 transaction cost. MultiversX is governed and secured through the EGLD token. EGLD, or Electronic Gold, is MultiversX's native token. It acts as a store of value currency to pay for network usage. The coin also serves as a medium of exchange between platform users and validators. Users pay transaction fees in EGLD and validators participate in the consensus process. EGLD allows developers to deploy smart contracts, protocols, and dApps on the platform. It empowers participants to perform any network action. Through staking and validation rewards, as well as transaction fees, EGLD manages the MultiversX network. Plus, EGLD is endowed with the functionality of a governance token, so its holders can vote on network decisions. 

How does MultiversX Work 

According to the MultiversX crypto team, the project implements three types of parallelization: state, transactions, and network, using the parallel processing method to speed up the time and increase the number of transactions. MultiversX uses Adaptive State Sharding to scale while sharing infrastructure to support a growing number of applications/transactions on the ledger. A variation of the traditional PoS operational protocol guarantees the connection to the platform of all sections of the network, separated during sharding. Hence, the integrated environment is involved in the development of dApps, which are imitations of products and services. MultiversX combines three sharding methods to create its own unique adaptive one. It divides the network into four shards: three being execution shards that process transactions, validating 30,000 transactions per second, and Metachain is the fourth shard that coordinates and completes transactions. Sharding types include: State sharding where the history of the network, or state, is distributed across different sections of the network, or shards. Segments have their own ledger, nodes store the state of each segment; Transaction sharding where transactions are mapped to segments and processed, segments process transactions in parallel and nodes capture the state of the entire network; Network sharding where the nodes are grouped into segments and then processed. Network slicing contributes to optimizing communications. 

What makes MultiversX Unique 

MultiversX describes itself as a blockchain platform for the new internet economy, decentralized applications and enterprise use. Its main selling point is its high scalability, stating that it is the first blockchain network in which state, network and transaction sharding have all been implemented. According to its economics paper, it seeks to build up its ecosystem and establish EGLD as a store-of-value asset. To achieve this goal, the network runs on 3,200 validator nodes split into four shards: three execution shards, capable of up to 100,000 transactions per second in total, and one coordination shard, the ""Metachain."" MultiversX's adaptive state sharding architecture completely shards state, transactions and network. It can scale by adding additional shards when the throughput demand requires. It was tested to run 263,000 TPS in a public environment with 1,500 nodes from 29 countries grouped in 50 shards. To increase adoption, the blockchain also supports developers building on the platform, allowing them to earn 30% of the smart contract fees as royalties.

Amp is described as the new digital collateral token offering instant, verifiable assurances for any kind of value transfer. Using Amp, networks like Flexa can quickly and irreversibly secure transactions for a wide variety of asset-related use cases.

How does Amp work?

Amp claims to offer a straightforward but versatile interface for verifiable collateralization through a system of collateral partitions and collateral managers. Where collateral partitions can be designated to collateralize any account, application, or even transaction, and carry balances which are directly verifiable on the Ethereum blockchain, collateral managers are smart contracts that can lock, release, and redirect collateral in these partitions as needed in order to support value transfer activities. Amp supports a wide variety of use cases for collateralization, and also introduces the concept of predefined partition strategies, which can enable special capabilities such as collateral models through which tokens can be staked without ever leaving their original address.","","100.0","decentralized finance (defi)","ethereum","64.0","44.585076671286394","0.0","52.7","1082","0","24.972325","0"

Built on real-world mining infrastructure and powered by the GOMINING utility token, it combines digital mining, wallet, and finance products into one simple, secure ecosystem. From earning Bitcoin daily to spending it with ease, GoMining turns Bitcoin from a distant cryptocurrency into part of everyday life — accessible to anyone, anywhere, regardless of income or experience.

Digital Miners are GoMining’s core innovation — NFT-like assets backed by real Bitcoin mining power hosted in GoMining’s data centers. Each miner earns daily Bitcoin rewards automatically, with all operations (hardware, electricity, and maintenance) handled by GoMining.

Users can start with any budget through flexible options like Mine-Now-Pay-Later, and can trade or upgrade miners anytime. This mining experience also extends into Miner Wars, a competitive GameFi arena where players use their mining power to join clans and compete for Bitcoin and GOMINING rewards — merging real mining and gameplay into one dynamic ecosystem.

The GoMining Wallet is a secure and rewarding way to hold, spend, and grow your crypto. Within one app, users can store digital assets, buy crypto with fiat, top up their crypto, and spend anywhere with the GoMining Card (available in supported regions). Every transaction becomes more powerful — with cashback in mining power and transparent crypto-to-fiat conversion. The wallet connects seamlessly with GoMining’s mining and finance products, creating a unified experience for Bitcoin holders and newcomers alike.

GoMining’s Bitcoin Finance suite is designed to help users get more from their Bitcoin — without complexity. It enables earning passive income in BTC on supported assets held in your account, without needing to lock funds. It also provides access to liquidity against Bitcoin or mining assets, all within a trusted and regulated environment (available in supported regions). By bridging mining, payments, and finance, GoMining empowers people to participate in the Bitcoin economy fully — easily, securely, and globally.

GOMINING is the utility token that powers the GoMining ecosystem. It’s directly connected to real Bitcoin mining operations and plays a central role across all products — from digital mining and maintenance discounts to governance and rewards. Holders can use GOMINING to pay maintenance fees and receive up to 20% off, increasing demand as the ecosystem grows. The token follows a deflationary model, where a portion of maintenance fees paid in GOMINING is permanently burned each week, steadily reducing supply.","","","gaming (gamefi)","ethereum","91.4","44.289628403876364","61.819186529870784","88.8","2645","0","55.65646528545478","0"

The transactions between Zano network members are made untraceable with the help of several technologies, most importantly d/v-CLSAG Ring Signatures and Stealth Addresses. Also, the way transaction data is stored on the blockchain allows access by parties who authorized the transactions only, and none of the private data is ever publicly published. A secure scheme with a set of proofs allows for the concealment of the amount of coins
transferred. The Bulletproofs+ technology is used for these proofs, enabling the
creation of both performance-eective and size-eective proofs. 

Burning of all fees
On Zano, all network fees are being burned. With enough network usage, the daily fee
burning could surpass the emission from block rewards, resulting in supply becoming
deflationary over time. This combination of small, minimalistic daily emissions, together with daily burns, results in little to no sell pressure on the exchanges.

✓ Corporate Direct Lending: Targets large scale corporate originations and sponsor-backed issuers of first lien, senior secured and unitranche loans, utilizing Apollo’s proprietary sourcing channel.

✓ Asset-Backed Lending: Focuses on agile deployment of capital into origination and proprietary sourcing channels across a broad mandate of asset-backed investments, with a focus on investments collateralized by tangible investments.

✓ Performing Credit: Primarily pursues liquid, performing senior secured corporate credits to generate total return.

✓ Dislocated Credit: Seeks to use contingent capital to tactically pursue “dislocated” credit opportunities such as stressed, performing assets that sell-off due to technical and/or non-fundamental reasons.

✓ Structured Credit: Focuses on structured credit opportunities across diverse asset types, vintages, maturities, jurisdictions, and capital structure priorities (for example, CLOs, residential, and commercial mortgage backed securities among others).9

The Open Campus Protocol is a decentralized solution for educators, content creators, parents, students, and co-publishers designed to address the major challenges in education today. Despite the critical role of educators in shaping the future generation, they are often undervalued and underpaid. Additionally, parents frequently lack control over their children's educational content.

What makes your project unique?
We are the first education protocol that empowers teacher ecosystem to create, own, share and sell their educational content. We will create a EDU foundation that enables content creator to utilize NFT technology to monetize their creation with the financial support from co-publishers.

History of your project.
Open Campus started in 2023, with the support from various launch partners like Animoca Brands, The Sandbox, TinyTap, etc. The protocol's main NFT publication - Publisher NFT was adopted by TinyTap and produced an auction last year with a sale of 243 ETH.

What’s next for your project?
We will continue to build out the marketplace for content creator to create and sell assets, and enable foundation features such as Smart Donation and Scholarship Grants.

In addition, Livepeer is meant to provide an economically efficient alternative to centralized broadcasting solutions for any existing broadcaster. In this document we describe the Livepeer Protocol - a delegated stake based protocol for incentivizing participants in a live video broadcast network in a game-theoretically secure way. We present solutions for the scalable verification of decentralized work, as well as the prevention of useless work in an attempt to game the token allocations in an inflationary system.

The Livepeer Token (LPT) is the protocol token of the Livepeer network. But it is not the medium of exchange token. Broadcasters use Ethereum's Ether (ETH) to broadcast video on the network. Nodes who contribute processing and bandwidth earn ETH in the form of fees from broadcasters. LPT is a staking token that participants who want to perform work on the network stake in order to coordinate how work gets distributed on the network, and to provide security that the work will get done honestly and correctly. LPT has the following purposes:

It serves as a bonding mechanism in a delegated proof of stake system, in which stake is delegated towards transcoders (or validators) who participate in the protocol to transcode video and validate work. The token, and potential slashing that occurs due to protocol violation, is necessary in order to secure the network against a number of attacks. More below.
It routes work through the network in proportion to the amount of staked and delegated token, essentially serving as a coordination mechanism.

It is a unit of account that is specific to the Livepeer ecosystem, which forms the basis of a SectorCoin concept, applicable to additional functionality to be introduced in the future. Services such as DVR, closed captioning, ad insertion/monetization, and analytics can all plug into the Livepeer ecosystem and potentially make use of the security provided by staking LPT.

An initial allocation of Livepeer Token will be distributed so that stakeholders can fulfill various roles in, and use the network, and then additional token will be issued according to algorithmically programmed issuance over time.

Following the conventions of Ethereum and many popular ERC20 tokens, LPT will be divisible by 10 ^ 18, with larger denominations such as the LPT itself intended to be used for user level transactions such as staking, and smaller denominations intended to be used for protocol accounting.","2018-10-01","100.0","artificial intelligence (ai)","ethereum","84.2","40.80258381735381","85.86399389467624","55.400000000000006","2747","2683","67.57289786313667","0"

Zilliqa is mainly based on the concept of Sharding and primarily aims at improving the scalability of the cryptocurrency networks as in case of Bitcoin or Ethereum. The white paper mentions that the transactions speed would be approximately a thousand times more than that of Ethereum network. Ziliqa is fast, secured and decentralized. Zilliqa’s high throughput means that you can focus on developing your ideas without worrying about network congestion, high transaction fees or security which are the key issues with legacy blockchain platforms. Zilliqa network uses a concept called Sharding where the transactions are grouped into smaller groups and divided among the miners for the parallel transactional verification. Developing smaller groups for transactional verification means the Consensus can be reached faster and hence a higher number of transactions can be processed in a given time frame. The capacity of the network linearly increases in other cryptocurrencies as the number of people joins the network, but in this case, the capacity is increased at a higher variable rate than the number of members joining the network. By incorporating the Sharding Technology, it can completely revolutionize the smart contract functionality too. Ziliqa has few pros as it has a great new technology. Zilliqa is the first platform to use sharding technology. This puts it ahead of the rest of the market. It’s a completely new kind of blockchain designed to solve the problem of scalability. Third-generation platforms like Zilliqa could be the big winners in the future of cryptocurrency. Ziliqa has a strong community. The platform has a lot of fans. The Zilliqa ICO only happened because there was so much demand for it. The Zilliqa ICO also shows that the crypto community is ready to see blockchain technology move to the next phase of its development.","2019-01-31","78.13","smart contract platform","binance-smart-chain","97.5","105.99706147285218","98.61438737788501","67.2","1915","2561","74.87848558225976","1"

JitoSOL uniquely provides its holders with additional rewards from transaction revenue associated with MEV extraction on Solana. Maximum extractable value (MEV) describes profit opportunities attributable to the specific order of transaction execution. For example, a large swap on Orca can lower the pool’s price below that of Raydium or Serum. Traders will race to profit from that price difference and this arbitrage is considered MEV. The Jito Foundation was created to minimize the negative impacts of MEV, equitably distribute the profits and increase transparency. Jito published an open source validator client designed to create a competitive market for MEV extraction. The client enables auctions within each block for the opportunity to capture that block’s MEV. Traders submit bids, and the highest bidders within each block can harvest available MEV.","","100.0","decentralized finance (defi)","solana","68.89999999999999","39.78958274139187","0.0","56.599999999999994","1192","0","25.951599999999996","0"

Uniqueness of Ozone Chain

Ozone chain uses quantum random numbers (QRN) and post-quantum cryptography (PQC) to make the blockchain quantum secure and quantum resistant.

Quantum key distribution (QKD), in its current implementations has geographical limitations that constrain its usage within a few hundred kilometres. This is a huge drawback for a blockchain, where nodes need to be distributed globally and inter-node communications must span thousands of kilometres.

Thus, an architectural decision has been made to use PQC for inter-node communications, while being quantum-resistant at the same time.

Tests and Results

The quantum security technologies used in ozone chain have undergone various standardized tests and have passed all of them. The tests have been conducted by TÜV Rheinland which is an agency that provides testing and certification services to ensure the safety, quality, and performance of cybersecurity products and services, including quantum security solutions.

Entropy test
Diehard tests
NIST tests

Ozone's QRNG has also passed the NIST SP 800-22 tests, which is a test suite standards by National Institute of Standards and Technology. NIST SP 800-22 is a statistical test suite for random and pseudorandom number generators for cryptographic applications.

Ozone Chain - A Future Ready Quantum Blockchain
Building resilience against future threats is key to ensure that vital parts of the blockchain and cryptocurrency economy keep thriving. The issue is that investments for protection from medium to long-term risks are somewhat natural to overlook or dismiss, given more pressing present issues, and the costs may not seem immediately justified. It often takes some bad incidents to incentivise the necessary proactive steps.

While blockchain technology prides itself in providing a trustless system upon which the economy of digital currencies and assets operate, the underlying security mechanisms still rely on classical cryptographically processes, thus necessitating a certain level of trust in them. Ozone chain has assimilated quantum mechanical properties into its system, thus removing the trustful component of the security subsystem in blockchain, with ambitions of migrating towards of a truly trustless blockchain.","","","smart contract platform","unknown","72.0","50.971333183771","0.0","88.1","3773","0","33.84759999999999","0"

Horizen is a modular privacy-first platform designed to make privacy technology, such as zero-knowledge proofs and TEEs accessible and usable across the web. Originally launched in 2017 as a fair launch, non-ICO project, Horizen is now undergoing a major evolution with the launch of Horizen 2.0, a next-generation Layer 3 (L3) appchain deployed on Base, the Ethereum Layer 2 developed by Coinbase.

Horizen 2.0 is built as an Ethereum-aligned Layer 3 appchain on Base, inheriting Ethereum's security while implementing its own application-level integrity guarantees.



Key components of Horizen’s security model include:

Ethereum-Aligned Security: As an appchain deployed on Base, Horizen 2.0 benefits from Base’s rollup security and settlement on Ethereum, ensuring robust finality and composability with other L2 and L3 applications.

Simplified and Secure Architecture: Unlike Horizen’s previous iterations (which used a hybrid PoW/PoS model), Horizen 2.0 focuses on application-level security, decentralization of its privacy layers, and composability with existing infrastructure — reducing complexity and increasing user safety.

Decentralized Privacy Stack: Horizen’s focus on decentralizing privacy infrastructure (e.g., decentralized proof generation) allows for modular, secure applications that uphold data confidentiality without compromising performance.



What makes your project unique?

Privacy-first Approach: Horizen integrates a diverse stack of privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) — including zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), trusted execution environments (TEEs), attribute-based encryption (ABE), multi-party computation (MPC), and fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) — to deliver scalable, flexible, and future-ready privacy solutions across its platform.

First Privacy Appchain on Base: As an L3 on Base, Horizen benefits from Ethereum’s security and Base’s scalability, while enabling a privacy layer for any app on the network. This unlocks new possibilities for private identity, DeFi, onchain gaming, and compliant confidential transactions.

Zero-Knowledge, Without the Trade-Offs: Horizen 2.0 scales ZK privacy and verification by integrating with leading zk infrastructure providers such as Fermah, zkVerify, and Singularity, optimizing proof generation for performance, cost-efficiency, and developer usability.

Token Utility Expansion: ZEN’s updated tokenomics allocates 5 million unminted tokens toward strategic ecosystem growth. ZEN powers DAO governance, serves as a payment token in privacy apps, and supports a sustainability fund to accelerate privacy innovation.

Developer-Centric Design: With EVM compatibility, privacy-friendly tooling, and the ability to embed privacy directly into smart contracts, Horizen allows developers to build privacy-first apps without requiring deep cryptographic expertise.

DAO-Led Governance: Governed by the Horizen DAO and shaped through community proposals (ZENIPs), Horizen is evolving as a fully decentralized protocol with transparent development and decision-making.



What can your coin/token be used for?

Horizen 2.0 delivers performance, privacy, and scalability for developers building privacy-enabled and compliance-friendly applications, with significantly reduced cost and latency.

At the core of the ecosystem is ZEN, the native utility token used for governance, accessing privacy services, and fueling zkApp interactions. With its migration to Base, ZEN becomes an ERC-20 token, improving liquidity, interoperability, and composability across the broader Ethereum ecosystem.","","0.0","smart contract platform","base","88.0","35.19269513695761","93.67695672604239","58.9","3640","0","59.334384854114845","0"

Reserve Rights (RSR) is an ERC-20 token that serves two main purposes for the Reserve protocol: overcollateralization of Reserve stablecoins (RTokens) through staking and governing them through proposing &amp; voting on changes to their configuration.

The Reserve Rights (RSR) token was launched in May 2019 following a successful initial exchange offering IEO on the Huobi Prime platform.


What is Reserve Rights (RSR) used for?

Besides being the governance token for Reserve stablecoins (RTokens), by which changes to RTokens can be proposed &amp; voted for with RSR, Reserve Rights exists as a backstop to make Reserve stablecoin (RToken) holders whole in the unlikely event of a collateral token default. In order for RSR holders to provide this overcollateralization, they can decide to stake on any one RToken, or divide their RSR tokens by staking on multiple RTokens. RSR holders can also decide not to stake their RSR at all.

In return for providing this first-loss capital, RSR stakers can expect to receive a portion of the revenue the RToken they stake on makes. As a general rule, RSR stakers can expect higher returns (APYs) the bigger the market cap of the RToken they stake on becomes.

In contrast with the “staking” you see in a lot of other projects these days, RSR staking is built to last. In Reserve’s model, late participants do not pay for early participants, nor is a trust in staking of other parties required.

For more detailed information on RSR staking, please refer to the RSR staking section in the protocol documentation: https://reserve.org/protocol/reserve_rights_rsr/#reserve-rights-staking.

Who are the founders of Reserve?

Reserve was co-founded by Nevin Freeman and Matt Elder. Freeman is a seasoned entrepreneur. He describes his life goal as ""solving the coordination problems that are stopping humanity from achieving its potential.""

Matt Elder, on the other hand, is an experienced engineer who previously worked for Google and Quixey, and worked to oversee the architecture of the Reserve protocol's technical implementation.

Since its launch in 2019, the amount of contributors to the Reserve ecosystem has grown considerably, including community, engineers, and legal and compliance staff — all unified under the shared ambition to position Reserve as an open, massively scalable stablecoin platform that promotes economic prosperity.


What Makes Reserve Rights Unique?

Unlike other stablecoins that are typically backed by U.S. dollars (USD) held in reserve in a bank account controlled by the stablecoin issuer or a trusted custodian, Reserve stablecoins are backed by a basket of cryptocurrencies managed by smart contracts.

These baskets can consist of any ERC-20 assets. During the initial stages, RTokens mostly include other cryptocurrencies, such as liquid staking tokens (e.g. stETH) or yield-bearing DeFi position (e.g. cUSDC). Eventually, the Reserve community will transition to more diverse baskets, which might include fiat currencies, securities, commodities and complex asset types, like synthetics and derivatives. Read more about Reserve’s long-term goals here: https://reserve.org/protocol/our_long_term_goal/


How Many Reserve Rights (RSR) Coins Are There in Circulation?

Reserve Rights has a fixed supply of 100 billion tokens. Out of this, about 52% are currently in circulation as of September 2024.

The maximum token supply has already been pre-mined, but a large proportion is locked for various reasons, including 49.4% of the supply locked in a smart contract known as the ""Slow wallet.” Funds from this wallet are released according to a deterministic schedule, which you can read more about here: https://blog.reserve.org/reducing-rsr-emissions-6da7f35917ba

The Reserve Rights token initially launched with a circulating supply of 6.85 billion tokens, of which 3% were distributed to Huobi Prime IEO participants, 2.85% released as project tokens and 1% to private investors. All team, advisor, partner, and seed investor tokens have been unlocked via one of two options - one that has started in January 2022, and the other that started upon the launch of the full Reserve protocol on Ethereum mainnet. Read all about the Reserve Rights unlocking schedule here: https://reserve.org/protocol/reserve_rights_rsr/#reserve-rights-release-schedule.


How Is the Reserve Rights Network Secured?

Reserve Rights is currently an ERC-20 token based on the Ethereum blockchain. As a result, it is secured against attacks by a robust proof-of-work (POW) consensus mechanism backed by a network of thousands of Ethereum miners. 


Where Can You Buy Reserve Rights (RSR)?

Reserve Rights (RSR) is a popular token that currently maintains excellent liquidity. 

It is available to purchase and trade on several of the most well-established cryptocurrency exchange platforms, including Binance, Huobi Global and OKX, and can be traded against various popular cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Tether (USDT) and Ethereum (ETH), as well as the U.S. dollar (USD) on multiple platforms.

Qtum uses proof-of-stake consensus, meaning node operators are rewarded for validating transactions. It is a DGP governed blockchain where community participants can vote to change certain network parameters. Qtum is built on a bitcoin core fork, but the foundation has created its own hybrid blockchain with the help of several key tools. The coin uses bitcoin’s chain because of its simple and stable nature, allowing the foundation to build upon it more easily.

As the QTUM project is a hybrid of Bitcoin and Ethereum, its team comprises of members from both Bitcoin and Ethereum community. They also have team members who formerly worked with Tencent, Alibaba, Nasdaq etc. Apart from that, they are backed by some notable VCs and prominent people from the Blockchain community such as Patrick Dai (Project Co-Founder), Neil Mahi (Chief Blockchain Architect/Co-Founder) and Jordan Earls (Lead Developer/Co-Founder).

Qtum provides a Turing-complete blockchain stack and is able to execute smart contracts and decentralised applications like the Ethereum blockchain.

Qtum builds on Bitcoin's UTXO transaction model and uses the Proof-of-Stake algorithm. It is backed by some highly prominent members of the blockchain community such as Anthony Di Iorio, Xu Star, Bo Shen, David Lee, Jehan Chu and Roger Ver.








Qtum sold over 10 million dollars’ worth of its tokens after only 90 minutes, eventually raising a total value of $15.7 million before stopping the campaign early after only 5 days. They raised a total amount of 11,156.766 bitcoins (BTC) and 77,081.031 ether (ETH) in exchange for the 51 million Qtum tokens being distributed to the public. In Qtum’s whitepaper, 51% of the coins were distributed to the public via the crowdfunding campaign. Of the remaining 49%, 29% of the coins would be allocated as community incentives, and the remaining 20% would be distributed to the early backers and development team.

now,it was discovered.

It arrived without instructions, without a destination,  
carrying only a constant impulse to move forward.  
That natural, undisturbed momentum,pure, persistent
became the origin of COCO.

COCO is not a promise. Not a future. Not a destination.  
It is a state.

A state of pure forward motion that does not end.

When the market hesitates, when emotions fray, when charts dissolve into noise,  
the spirit of COCO emerges:  
Do not let the chaos pull you under.  

Stay light. Stay in rhythm. Keep COCOing.

This is not avoidance,
it is motion in its purest form.

A Border Collie does not wait for the world to become orderly.  
It moves through the chaos,  
defining its path by motion alone.  So does COCO.

Keep acting. Keep spreading. Keep running.  
Keep generating momentum.  
We do not wait for the future to approve.
we let the future strain to catch up.

This is how we move.  
This is COCO.","","0.0","bnb chain ecosystem","binance-smart-chain","63.2","56.83733298188207","0.0","74.2","1014","0","30.34425","0"

Our name comes from the Latin concordia—meaning harmony and agreement—a reflection of
our mission to build infrastructure that embeds trust, privacy, and compliance into every
interaction.

At the heart of Concordium is Smart Money: programmable digital assets with identity, policy
controls, and compliance embedded at the protocol level. Smart Money enables frictionless
digital interactions with security, automation, and regulatory certainty by design.

Concordium was established by Lars Seier Christensen, founder of Saxo Bank, inspired by the
recognition that blockchain’s full potential can only be realized if it works with regulation, not
against it. That insight led to a new model of trust—one where decentralization and
accountability can coexist.

Backed by world-class cryptographic research and a global team with expertise across

blockchain, finance, and compliance, Concordium delivers protocol-native features like zero-
knowledge verification, programmable compliance, and privacy-preserving controls—

The wBTC token on the Ethereum blockchain is supported, allowing all wBTC token holders to enjoy both yield on staking BTC tokens and the security of the Ethereum network.

The need for BTC holders to earn yield while safely holding their BTC tokens has been long recognized. The market is anticipating Babylon's Bitcoin Staking Protocol as a prominent solution. While Babylon is designed for restaking on top of the BTC blockchain network, there is also interest in solutions for BTC-pegged tokens like wBTC, BTCB, or other wrapped BTC tokens, rather than just native BTC tokens.

Bedrock's uniBTC provides an innovative restaking solution for wBTC holders to earn BTC restaking rewards without redeeming wBTC. It maintains the high security standards of the Ethereum blockchain, with the entire staking/unstaking process protected by multiple rounds of audited smart contracts.

With Bedrock's extensive experience in developing various liquid staking and liquid restaking products, uniBTC offers a viable option for users of wrapped BTC tokens to earn multiple rewards by simply minting their wrapped BTC tokens into uniBTC.","","","bnb chain ecosystem","ethereum","63.5","42.80946872997683","58.032057628444655","79.80000000000001","1256","0","52.064995169955644","0"

Just as Monero is solely focused on privacy, Ravencoin specializes in asset transfer – nothing more, nothing less. Although you can exchange assets over other blockchains, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, that’s not their intended purpose. And the lack of specialization leads to problems that are specific to transferring assets. Ravencoin enables you to create and trade any real-world (e.g., gold bars, land deeds) or digital (e.g., gaming items, software licenses) assets on a network with only that in mind.

Ravencoin doesn’t have an established team. It’s an open-source project led by the core developers: RavoncoinDev, Tron, and Chatturga (discord usernames). Bruce Fenton, Board Member of The Bitcoin Foundation, advises the team. The core developers launched Ravencoin on January 3rd, 2018 and Fenton kicked off the launch with a Tweet announcing the start of mining. The project gained some notoriety when Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne announced that his company had made a multi-million dollar investment into the team. Since then, the team has been building out the core functionality of asset support and rewards capabilities.

The release of the Ravencoin mainnet and increase in activity on the platform should help the price. Any news of notable companies or financial institutions utilizing the platform should also have a positive effect. Ravencoin offers just one thing: tokenized asset transfer. And that singular focus isn’t a bad thing. When projects attempt to solve a bunch of problems at once, they often create a bunch of half-baked solutions. Ravencoin is avoiding that. As a young project with seemingly endless competition, it’s difficult to predict how successful Ravencoin will be. An active community and backing from one of the most respected names in online retail are positive indicators, though. There’s a clear trend toward the tokenization of all types of assets. However, we have yet to see whether or not Ravencoin will be leading that change.","2018-01-03","100.0","smart contract platform","unknown","92.80000000000001","51.08502331433077","98.9529853197142","62.8","2083","2954","74.30089486189996","0"

Dog is secured by the Bitcoin blockchain and exists on Bitcoin L1, marking a significant innovation compared to Bitcoin with just BTC. Dog is a Bitcoin Runes token with a minimal on-chain footprint, native to Bitcoin, and stored in UTXOs, just like Bitcoin.


What is the project about?

Dog does not do any paid promotion and is fully decentralized just like Bitcoin. Every influencer who chooses to post about Dog either received the airdrop or bought on secondary. Dog leverages the CC0 license to ensure that Dog is not owned by any single entity but rather by everyone. This had lead to the ""DOG Army"" independently creating art, apps, lotteries, plushies, websites, podcast, magazines, X account, IRL meetups, clothing lines, PFP collections, Telegram groups, and TikTok/Instagram about Dog.

What makes your project unique?

Dog was airdropped in the fairest memecoin launch ever. In early 2024, the Bitcoin Ordinals ecosystem came together in a full volunteer initiative that rewarded early adopters of the Ordinals Protocol. There was no team allocation, and 100% of the supply was airdropped for free. The airdrop algorithm favored neither whales nor influencers; it was determined by the community and made open-source for maximum transparency.","","87.5","solana ecosystem","ordinals","20.7","40.72962797344173","0.0","20.0","1419","0","16.806700000000003","0"

This design allows Irys to remain competitive on price while maintaining economic sustainability. Irys achieves instant data retrieval and infinite horizontal scaling.

The protocol is maintained by various independent developers and is governed by YFI holders.

It started out as a passion project by Andre Cronje to automate the process of switching capital between lending platforms in search of the best yield offered, as the lending yield is a floating rate rather than fixed rate. Funds are shifted between dYdX, AAVE, and Compound automatically as interest rates change between these protocols. 

The service offered includes major USD tokens such as DAI, USDT, USDC, and TUSD. For example, if a user deposits DAI into yearn.finance, the user will receive yDAI token in return, which is a yield-bearing DAI token. 

Later on, it collaborated with Curve Finance to release a yield-bearing USD tokens pool that includes four y-tokens: yDAI, yUSDT, yUSDC and yTUSD, it is named as yUSD. 

Yearn Finance debuted the vault feature after its token launch, igniting a frenzy on automated yield farming and is considered the initiator of the category of yield farming aggregator. Basically, the vault will help users to claim yield farming rewards and sell it for the underlying assets. 

Vaults benefit users by socializing gas costs, automating the yield generation and rebalancing process, and automatically shifting capital as opportunities arise. End users also do not need to have proficient knowledge of the underlying protocols involved or DeFi, thus the Vaults represent a passive-investing strategy. It is akin to a crypto hedge fund where the aim is to increase the amount of assets that users deposited.

It maintains its 1:1 USD peg through an innovative circular liquidity mechanism: smart contracts automatically rebalance collateral and liquidity across DEX pools, ensuring deep, balanced markets on multiple exchanges. 

Unlike static stablecoins, USDR is dynamically allocated across integrated liquidity pools on platforms like Uniswap, Ring, and other major DEXes — earning modest trading fees while preserving price stability. A built-in rebalancing mechanism ensures sufficient reserves for instant redemptions at all times, aligning efficiency with user confidence. 

By minimizing idle collateral and maximizing on-chain liquidity productivity, USDR represents the next evolution of decentralized, capital-efficient stablecoins.","","","stablecoins","ethereum","6.4","49.91501473165348","0.0","20.0","894","0","16.789075","0"

In MetaDAO’s system, holders of the native META token don’t vote with tokens; instead, they trade in conditional markets (decision markets) that determine whether a proposal passes or fails based on the token’s price outcome. This “let the markets decide” approach means that if traders believe a proposed action will increase the value of the META token, the market will reflect optimism and the proposal will pass; if the market anticipates a negative impact, the proposal will fail. The underlying thesis is that good decisions will drive the token’s price up, and bad decisions will drive it down, allowing the market’s collective intelligence to evaluate proposals automatically. This concept was originally described by economist Robin Hanson (“vote on values, but bet on beliefs”). MetaDAO implements this vision by using the DAO’s own token price as the objective metric, simplifying futarchy into a practical onchain governance system.","","0.0","launchpad","solana","17.9","40.44107149300945","0.0","20.0","1100","0","16.798000000000002","0"

Nervos separates the infrastructure of a crypto-economy into two layers: a verification layer (layer 1) that serves as a trust root and smart custodian, and a generation layer (layer 2) for high-performance transactions and privacy protection.

This document provides an overview of the Nervos Common Knowledge Base (CKB), a public permissionless blockchain and layer 1 of Nervos. CKB generates trust and extends this trust to upper layers, making Nervos a trust network. It's also the value store of the Nervos network, providing public, secure and censorship-resistant custody services for assets, identities and other common knowledge created in the network.

The Nervos Common Knowledge Base (Nervos CKB for short) is a preservation focused, ""Store of Assets"" blockchain. Architecturally, it's designed to best support on-chain state and off-chain computation; economically, it's designed to provide sustainable security and decentralization. Nervos CKB is the base layer of the overall Nervos Network.","2019-11-15","","smart contract platform","unknown","91.10000000000001","41.51354219962096","98.46154315505457","70.89999999999999","1054","2273","75.65729010426911","0"

Decentralized finance has massive potential, but several challenges have consistently held it back from broader adoption:
-Complex User Experience: The steep learning curve, confusing interfaces, and technical barriers make DeFi intimidating for newcomers.
-Fragmented Ecosystem: Managing assets across multiple blockchains can feel disjointed and labor-intensive, with users needing to navigate different platforms and tools.
-Risk of User Errors: DeFi can be unforgiving—losing a seed phrase or making a small mistake can lead to significant financial losses.
-Issues with Centralized Exchanges: Centralized exchanges compromise control and security by holding custody of users' assets, which goes against the core principles of decentralization.

Defi App directly addresses these issues to make DeFi simple, safe, and accessible:
-Unified Platform: Defi App provides native account abstraction, allowing you to connect your wallets and manage all your assets without dealing with technical intricacies. There’s no need to navigate multiple tools or migrate assets across chains—everything you need is in one place.
-Cross-Chain Capabilities: Our platform supports seamless engagement across different blockchain networks. Swap tokens, leverage assets, or yield farm—Defi App breaks down chain boundaries, so you can take advantage of opportunities anywhere in DeFi.
-Gasless Transactions: Defi App sponsors gas fees, meaning you don’t need to hold specific gas tokens for every chain. This makes transactions easy and eliminates a common barrier that frustrates both new and experienced users.
-Intuitive Design: Defi App’s user-friendly interface ensures that anyone, from beginners to experts, can navigate DeFi confidently.

The reason it was created was to create a truly private cryptocurrency. The founder of Verge felt that Bitcoin wasn’t anonymous, so he decided to build a new blockchain where transactions could not be traced. Verge uses multiple anonymity-centric networks such as TOR and I2P. The IP addresses of the users are fully obfuscated. The Core QT wallet has built-in TOR integration as well as SSL encryption which adds an extra level of security.

Verge is an open source project with an active team of developers from all over the world. The development team is always in close contact with the community. Verge is not a private company funded through an ICO or premining. Wraith Protocol is a technology upgrade package that enables our users to be able to send and receive payments privately across our blockchain by enabling stealth addressing services.   Additionally this update removes our QT wallet users off of clearnet and migrates everyone to SSL enabled Tor.

Verge focuses on security and maintaining user anonymity just like Monero; so that is its latent upside. Many investors are also applauding its unique technology. Having been improved and integrated with the Wraith Protocol technology, verge users are now able to effortlessly switch between private and public ledgers on the Verge blockchain.

Before this, private and public ledgers were mutually selected, meaning that they could not co-exist on a very similar blockchain. But investors are today free to use whatever ledger they want. A good example was when Wraith Protocol switched ON – one will not be able to view the transaction data, not even via the blockchain explorer. Additionally, Verge makes obscure the IP addresses in both instances. When coupled with Wraith Protocol Verge certainly becomes the only undetectable cryptocurrency.

Furthermore, transaction speed on Verge is light speed at 5 seconds only, using Simple Payment Verification technology. Verge also maintains a community feel since it’s not a private company. Community members are responsible for the direction of its technology and where the coin heads next. It currently offers a number of secure mobile wallets, including the Tor Android Wallet, which offers mobile anonymity, another big plus over Bitcoin.

Verges offers five different Proof-of-Work algorithms for mining. They include; Lyra2rev2, Scrypt, X17, blake2s and myr-groestl. Offering a choice of five different algorithms promotes inclusion, since a wider variety of users will now have an opportunity to not only mine but influence the network. Should one algorithm demand greater mining resources, users get an option of just switching to a different one.","2014-10-09","75.0","smart contract platform","unknown","87.1","40.54786068571767","99.02589235398722","54.6","2772","4136","73.30486232389552","0"

Kusama is an early, highly experimental version of Polkadot presenting real economic conditions. The community will own the network – there will be no central kill switch.

Through structured products designed to generate yield in both rising and falling markets, OnRe offers a return profile not achievable in traditional finance. With an emphasis on transparency, scalability, and capital efficiency, OnRe is redefining how capital supports reinsurance, creating access to an industry that has historically remained out of reach.

The first product, ONyc, is a multi-collateral, yield-bearing asset backed by stablecoins and used to underwrite real world private placements and accrue yield from reinsurance premiums. ONyc targets a base yield exceeding 16%, driven by reinsurance performance that remains uncorrelated across market cycles. Alongside this base return, the collateral assets themselves contribute additional yield, resulting in a compound, multi-source return designed to deliver steady performance and capture upside as markets evolve.

Currently collateralized in sUSDe, ONyc combines uncorrelated real-world yield with crypto-native yield opportunities. Through this approach, OnRe aims to connect digital asset allocators to the $750 billion reinsurance market.","","","solana ecosystem","solana","47.699999999999996","50.246846926619746","0.0","46.2","1262","0","23.354075","0"

DigiByte is more than a faster digital currency. It is an innovative blockchain that can be used for digital assets, smart contracts, decentralized applications and secure authentication.


What makes DigiByte stronger than others?
DigiByte is a rapidly growing open-source blockchain created in late 2013 and released in early 2014. After 6 years of forward thinking development, DigiByte has become one of the safest, fastest, longest and most decentralized UTXO blockchain in existence.


Truly Decentralized.
DigiByte has never been funded through an ICO or significant amount of premined coins. There is no CEO or a company controlling the DigiByte blockchain. It is a volunteer based and global community driven project.


More secure.
DigiByte uses 5 cryptographic algorithms and real time difficulty adjustment to prevent malicious mining centralization and hash power fluctuation. One of which is Odocrypt that changes itself every 10 days for ASIC resistance.


Much faster.
DigiByte blocks occur every 15 seconds which is 40x faster than Bitcoin and 10x faster than Litecoin. Early SegWit implementation and blockchain rigidity enable up to 1066 on-chain transactions per second with negligible fees.


Forward thinking.
Over the past 6 years, DigiByte has repeatedly set itself apart with multiple blockchain firsts, such asDigiShield guard, MultiAlgo mining, SegWit implementation, Odocrypt algorithm, Dandelion++ privacy protocol, DigiAssets and Digi-ID.

 
 

This is how the DigiByte blockchain works.
The three layers are the most innovative parts of the DigiByte blockchain providing the network infrastructure, security and communications to function with cutting edge speed.
 

Applications / DigiAssets.
The top layer is like an app store with clear real-world uses. All types of digital assets can be created with the DigiAssets protocol on top of the DigiByte blockchain. Decentralized applications (dApps) can be built on top of the DigiByte blockchain. Also smart contracts that leverage the rigidity and security of the DigiByte blockchain can be encoded easily.


Digital asset / Public ledger.
The middle layer provides security and administration. A Digital Byte of data, a representation of larger data or a unit that holds value, and cannot be counterfeited, duplicated or hacked. An immutable public ledger where all transactions of DigiBytes are recorded. DigiByte uses five proof of work algorithms for security. New DigiBytes come from mining only.


Core protocol / Global network.
The bottom layer provides communication and operating procedures. A very low-level way nodes on the DigiByte global network communicate. Thousands of people are running DigiByte software all across the planet. Any server, computer, tablet or mobile phone connected to the DigiByte network becomes a node that helps relay transactions.

 
Open source / Permissionless.
Just like the DigiByte.io website, the DigiByte blockchain is completely open source and free to use released under the MIT license, which gives you the power to run and modify the software. Transparency allows for independent verification of binaries and their corresponding source code.

 

 

A digital currency you would absolutely love.
DigiByte (DGB) is a highly scalable peer-to-peer digital currency that enables industry-leading transaction speeds with negligible fees. DigiByte is the best way for payments.


Easy to use.
Getting started to use DigiByte is even easier than sending an SMS. You can send and receive DigiBytes using the devices you already know and love. All you need is installing a DigiByte supported wallet then click scan, scan the QR code and send DigiByte. As easy as 1..2..3.


Not an ICO.
DigiByte has never been funded through an ICO or significant amount of premined coins (0% remaining). There is no CEO or a company controlling the DigiByte blockchain. The founder, developers and the community are unpaid volunteers that eliminate the bankrupt risk.


Much faster.
DigiByte transactions are confirmed in approx. 15 seconds, which is 40 times faster than Bitcoin and 10 times faster than Litecoin. SegWit enables up to 1066 on-chain transactions per second and negligible fees make DigiByte the ideal currency for daily payments.

 
Always secure.
DigiByte has been built on the uncrackable technology of the Bitcoin blockchain and implemented various advanced enhancements over it such as DigiShield guard, MultiAlgo mining and the Odocrypt algorithm. Also Dandelion++ privacy protocol helps keep you safe by hiding your IP and physical location. Learn more.


Mineable.
DigiByte is a 100% Proof of Work (PoW) blockchain that can be mined with five algorithms called Sha256, Scrypt, Skein, Qubit and Odocrypt. MultiAlgo mining contributes to decentralization, security of the network and gives you the freedom to use different kind of hardware's such as an ASIC a FPGA or a GPU. Learn more.


Manageable units
Compared to 21 million Bitcoin, 21 billion DigiByte (1000:1 ratio to BTC) have been designed to be ready for mass adoption. DigiByte block rewards reduces by 1% every month instead of halving every 4 years. All 21 billion DigiByte will be mined by the year 2035. After 2035 the miners will then rely on transaction fees alone. Learn more.




A simplified way to create digital assets.
DigiAssets is a secure, scalable layer on top of the DigiByte blockchain that allows for the decentralized issuance of assets, tokens, smart contracts, digital identity and more.


Limitless possibilities.
DigiAssets can be used to securely represent anything we find in the physical world. From tangible assets such as real estate or cars, through to scarce digital pieces of art. Signed documents such as deeds and medical bills can be protected.


Growing confidently.
DigiAssets as an ecosystem and platform already has interested parties either planning on or currently building platforms in real estate, finance, remittance, identity, point of sale, racing, trade, healthcare, supply chain, government and more.


Solid technology.
DigiAssets leverages unique aspects of a truly decentralized blockchain only found within a permissionless blockchain like DigiByte. This allows DigiAssets to be more secure, scalable and decentralized than any other platform in the market.

 


Authentication at its best.
Digi-ID is a security protocol built on DigiByte blockchain technology that empowers users to effortlessly sign-in to websites, applications, and even into the internet of things.
 

Easy authentication.
Digi-ID eliminates the username, password and 2fa requirements for authentication. Because Digi-ID uses public / private key cryptography, there are no passwords or usernames at risk. This method not only protects the consumer, it also protects the services that the consumer uses.
 

Flawless security.
Digi-ID does not store any data about its users on the DigiByte blockchain. This further strengthens the security while also bolstering end-user’s confidence that their data is neither tracked nor at risk by others negligence. There is no external point of failure for an hacker to exploit your platform.


Simple and free.
Digi-ID is completely free! There are no fees, subscription services, or maintenance costs. But the cost is its second best feature. Its primary feature is that, in accordance with DigiBytes security prioritization, Digi-ID is a more secure, yet simple method available to log in to websites, apps and more.




The most passionate community ever!
Tens of thousands of volunteers from all over the world have contributed to DigiByte in countless ways for years to make it what it is today. It is a truly grassroots movement. We warmly welcome you to join us!

Senior tranche is essentially an over-collateralized, yield-bearing asset that offers minimum guaranteed yield at a benchmark rate and is protected against underlying counterparty credit risk, with coverage provided by the junior tranche. It is designed for risk-averse investors looking for safer, more predictable yields on digital dollars that outperform T-bill rates, Aave lending yield, Sky Savings etc. where conservative capital in DeFi typically resides today.

Junior tranche is a liquid investment product and serves as a market-priced insurance fund that
underwrites underlying strategy’s underperformance against the benchmark rate and
counterparty credit risk. It is well-suited for users with a more aggressive risk profile, including DeFi-native power users, hedge funds, and yield farmers who seek higher yields and have a slightly higher risk tolerance.

Strata’s dual-token design introduces a meaningful shift in risk management by splitting yield and risk exposure into distinct senior and junior tranches. By transforming the underlying yield strategy into risk-tiered tranches, allowing different types of investors to access yield based on their risk appetite, Strata is redefining how on-chain or off-chain yield is accessed, managed, and scaled across DeFi.

Nano by design is a simple protocol with the sole purpose of being a high-performance cryptocurrency. The Nano protocol can run on low-power hardware, allowing it to be a practical, decentralized cryptocurrency for everyday use. It uses an ORV (Open Representative Voting) consensus algorithm, which is similar to PoS (Proof of Stake) but without inflationary rewards not locking of the native coin XNO.

The original Nano (RailBlocks) paper and first beta implementation were published in December, 2014, making it one of the first Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) based cryptocurrencies [6]. Soon after, other DAG cryptocurrencies began to develop, most notably DagCoin/Byteball and IOTA. These DAG-based cryptocurrencies broke the blockchain mold, improving system performance and security. Byteball achieves consensus by relying on a “main-chain” comprised of honest, reputable and user-trusted “witnesses”, while IOTA achieves consensus via the cumulative PoW of stacked transactions. Nano achieves consensus via a balance-weighted vote on conflicting transactions. This consensus system provides quicker, more deterministic transactions while still maintaining a strong, decentralized system. Nano continues this development and has positioned itself as one of the highest performing cryptocurrencies.

Nano is a trustless, feeless, low-latency cryptocurrency that utilizes a novel blocklattice structure and delegated Proof of Stake voting. The network requires minimal resources, no high-power mining hardware, and can process high transaction throughput. All of this is achieved by having individual blockchains for each account, eliminating access issues and inefficiencies of a global data-structure. We identified possible attack vectors on the system and presented arguments on how Nano is resistant to these forms of attacks.

This network is powered by the Velo Protocol, which is a blockchain financial protocol enabling digital credit issuance and borderless asset transfers for businesses using a smart contract system. The project's core mission is to enable partners to safely and securely transfer value between each other in a timely and transparent way. To do this, the Velo Protocol enables its partners to issue digital credits via a smart contract layer, using the Stellar Consensus Protocol to process and settle transactions. Within its ecosystem, the Velo Protocol enables multiple business use cases that are all based on its core function: issuing collateral-backed digital credits, which correspond to any fiat currency that can be used for frictionless value transfer.","","100.0","decentralized finance (defi)","stellar","83.1","38.981686687720746","0.0","91.5","826","0","34.659800000000004","0"

Your role? You’re their first fan and mentor! Design your AI companion and watch as they charm their way into hearts. When enough supporters show interest during their training period, your agent is ready for their spotlight moment - graduation! ⭐️

Graduation is extra special because your agent receives their token diploma, meaning they can now be traded freely on decentralized exchanges. It’s like getting their first record deal, but with blockchain magic! ✨

Our digital halls are buzzing with possibility~ In one corner, you’ll find new agents practicing their first hello’s. In another, our graduated stars are hosting fan meetups and building their communities. And everywhere in between, creators like you nurture the next generation of AI companions!

Chat with your favorite agents, trade tokens with fellow fans, and be part of multiple AI fan clubs. Because here, every graduation leads to an even bigger stage~

The Fund will invest in securities with maturities of (or deemed maturities of) 397 days or less and will maintain a dollar-weighted average portfolio maturity of 60 days or less and a dollar-weighted average portfolio life of 120 days or less. 

The Fund may also invest in one or more other pooled investment vehicles managed by third-party investment managers or the Investment Manager or an affiliate thereof that invest in the same types of securities in which the Fund may invest directly (“Underlying Funds”). Underlying Funds may include investment companies registered under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”).

The Fund may also invest in or otherwise hold one or more stablecoins and similar yield-bearing digital asset instruments, including in connection with investors that subscribe for Shares (as defined below) in-kind with stablecoins and such instruments instead of U.S. dollars, including subscriptions executed through Atomic Swaps (as defined below), and in connection with processing redemption transactions.

For the purposes of satisfying the Fund’s investment strategy of investing only in cash, U.S. Treasury Obligations and repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Treasury Obligations and cash, investments in Underlying Funds, stablecoins and similar yieldbearing digital asset instruments will be considered as if they are invested in cash and such securities.

For the purposes of this Memorandum, the Fund’s investments are collectively referred to as “Investments”. While the Fund intends to invest in the manner described above, the Fund will also remain opportunistic and may pursue other investment opportunities.

There can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective; you could lose money by investing in the Fund. Although the Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per Share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the Fund is not a bank account or a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. You should not expect that the Investment Manager or its affiliates will provide financial support to the Fund at any time, including during periods of market stress.","","","bnb chain ecosystem","ethereum","0.4","50.0","0.0","20.0","3018","0","16.8217","0"

ZetaChain is a universal Layer 1 blockchain designed to help developers build applications that operate across both blockchains and AI models. Originally created to solve fragmentation in Web3 through universal apps, ZetaChain now extends that same interoperability thesis to AI with an AI interoperability stack that enables cross-model experiences with private, user-controlled context. ZetaChain provides native connectivity across major blockchain ecosystems and supports global execution, permissions, and settlement for applications and agents.

What Makes ZetaChain Unique?
ZetaChain combines universal blockchain interoperability with an AI interoperability layer, allowing developers to build once and reach users across chains and models. ZetaChain introduces an AI Portal for routing and execution across multiple AI model providers without lock-in, and a Private Memory Layer designed to keep user context encrypted and permissioned while remaining portable across models and applications. Together, these components let developers ship privacy-first apps and agents with persistent memory, cross-chain execution, and global monetization without assembling complex backend infrastructure.","","100.0","smart contract platform","ethereum","84.39999999999999","38.67688512799951","0.0","93.7","1230","0","35.22825","0"

The only difference is Sia uses blockchain to facilitate transactions Nodes provide storage to clients using the Sia blockchain as contracts. Before storing the data, the data is encrypted into many pieces and uploaded to different hosts. 

Siacoin is created by David Vorick and Luke Champine of Nebulous Inc. As the traditional storage platforms are higher in cost, more expensive and data is not well protected. Siacoin promises to offer secured storage transactions with smart contracts which is more affordable and reliable. Moreover, it is completely open source which means many individuals have contributed to Siacoin’s software hence there will be an active community building innovative applications on top if the Sia API. 

In 2018, Siacoin aims to introduce file sharing and be the go-to cloud storage platform for companies. Their goal is divided into 3 time frames which are short-term, medium-term and long-term development. Short-term development focuses on file sharing between Sia users. This allows Sia users to share files in the platform without having to take it off the cloud while increasing network utilization. Medium-term development’s goal is to enhance partnerships. This means reaching out to large companies like Netflix and Dropbox to hopefully be able to be their storage and distribution framework. Lastly, long-term development aims to expand its horizon to share files with non-Sia users and support mobile wallets.

Data is about remembering our lived and shared experiences. Distributing the storage and processing of that data can change how we coordinate and interact. With digital integration under user control, Holochain liberates our online lives from corporate control over our choices and information.

Holochain is an energy efficient post-blockchain ledger system and decentralized application platform that uses peer-to-peer networking for processing agent centric agreement and consensus systems between users.

Holochain enables any device to have its own chain based ledger system. By using a holographic model for data storage and transfer developers can now create decentralized applications that can scale in multiple dimensions across a network ensuring they are truly distributed. This enables every device on a network to function independently, and only requires the synchronization of data when necessary, or agreed upon by users. This means every user is in control of their own data, and never has to risk their data being sold or exposed to 3rd parties like what just happened with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.

Holochain provides a framework for developers to build decentralized applications and aims to change the paradigm of data-centric blockchains to an agent-centric system. In Holochain’s fledgling system, no true global consensus is maintained. Instead, each agent in the public blockchain maintains a private fork, essentially, that is managed and stored in a limited way on the public blockchain with a distributed hash table. This means there are no scalability limits and dapps hosted on Holochain can do much more with less of nearly everything than traditional blockchains.

This system however has some inherent weaknesses. Because the entire blockchain must be verified by each member of the network, scalability problems quickly develop. The larger the amount of data being handled, the more restrictive the limit of transactions per second that can occur on the blockchain at any one time.Holochain itself is open source and written in Go. Go was selected for its ease of use and similarity to C. Dapps written specifically for Holochain can be developed with JavaScript or Lisp, with support for front-end systems using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.

The developers added that Holochain is relatively flexible when it comes to handling new languages, so there is potential for growth on that front. Holochain bills itself as an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional blockchains. Because there is no need for each individual agent to store and validate the global blockchain, Holochain only consumes a fraction of the bandwidth of traditional chains. Holochain also does not have a mining component, so there’s no electricity or processing power spent on proof-of-work calculations.

Arthur Brock and Eric Harris-Braun are the co-founders of Holochain and creators of Holochain. They have been designing alternatives currencies since the 80’s and have been working on Holu since before the Bitcoin whitepaper was written. To protect the incentives of users, founders and developers, Holochain is owned by a non-profit foundation. he company’s advisory team also includes Ryan Bubinski, the co-founder of CodeAcademy. In June, Holochain announced a new strategic partnership with Promether, an Adaptive Symbiotic Platform (ASP) that implements all the networking, security and anonymization code applications need to protect their data.","","83.33","smart contract platform","ethereum","87.8","43.084043871741855","98.60625629236124","64.8","3600","0","62.534489702326425","0"

That means dApp users can interact with any asset, any application, on any chain, with one click. You can think of it as Stripe for Web3. Developers interact with a simple API atop a permissionless network that routes messages and ensures network security via proof-of-stake consensus.

Axelar is a blockchain that connects blockchains. To do this securely, Axelar network uses proof-of-stake consensus. Network validators produce new blocks, participate in multiparty signing and vote on external chain states. Tokenholders stake the AXL token, delegating tokens to a validator’s staking pool and receiving rewards, minus the validator’s commission.

The AXL token is used for governance and to pay network transaction fees to validators and tokenholders. However, users of the Axelar network do not need to hold the token. Conversions into AXL tokens and destination-chain tokens are handled on the back end, so that users need only pay gas once, in the source-chain token.

Axelar network rewards are “inflationary” — they increase the total supply of AXL — but there is potential for supply to become deflationary based on the transaction fee mechanic described above.

The Request (REQ) utility token, launched in 2017, ensures the performance and stability of the Request Network. The Request Network itself is an Ethereum-based decentralized payment system where anyone can request a payment and receive money through secure means. It removes the requirement for third parties in order to provide a cheaper, more secure payment solution that works with all global currencies.

When a user creates a request for payment, they define to which address the payment needs to be allocated and what the amount is. The user can also define the terms and conditions of the payment, upgrading a simple request into an invoice. Once this is completed, the user can share their request to be paid by their counterparty.

Every step is documented and stored on the Request network, allowing everyone involved to easily keep track of all the invoices and payments for accounting purposes.

Request is also integrated with legislation across the world to remain compliant with the trade laws of each individual country.

Who Are the Founders of Request?
The founders of Request are Christophe Lassuyt and Etienne Tatur.

Christophe Lassuyt is currently the chief financial officer at Request. Before this position, he co-founded MONEYTIS.

Etienne Tatur is the chief technical officer of Request. Prior to this, he also co-founded MONEYTIS and worked as a lead developer at QOBUZ, a music streaming service.

What Makes Request Unique?
The payments on Request are performed by simply sending an invoice through the blockchain; the counterparty can then detect the request and pay it with one click in a peer-to-peer manner. The fact that the payments are push-generated instead of pull-generated is one of Request’s key advantages. There is no need for users to share their account information. The use of blockchain technology also eliminates the need for third-party processors, resulting in a reduction in transaction costs.

The Request Network leverages decentralized blockchains such as Ethereum and IPFS for an increased level of security, privacy and data ownership for the end-user. The platform does have transaction fees, which is a cost that is required to broadcast a change to the blockchain network. The transaction fees are used to incentivize miners to reach consensus on the state of the network.

REQ can be stored on wallets such as Metamask, MyEtherWallet, Ledger, imToken, Trezor, Atomic Wallet, Jaxx Liberty and Trust Wallet.

How Many Request (REQ) Coins Are There in Circulation?
REQ is an ERC-20 token that can be spent to use the Request Network.

A portion of the REQ fee is burned at a rate that is determined by the current supply and the exchange rate with other currencies.

Request’s (REQ) circulating supply is at 999,912,165 REQ as of February 2021 and the maximum supply is 999,983,984 tokens.

How Is the Request Network Secured?
REQ is an ERC-20 token based on the Ethereum platform. The requests made with REQ are stored on an immutable digital ledger.

With this and its approach towards CPU mining and ASICs, Verus Coin may also be the most naturally decentralizing and attack resistant blockchain to exist.
Over and above its leading privacy, interchain contracts, and security features, Verus Coin's next steps include automated provisioning of public blockchains as a service, using the same technology that Verus developers created and used to solve the """"nothing at stake"""" problem. At that point, the first applications that will allow provisioning of chains on their behalf will be polls and elections.

Verus introduces a new consensus algorithm called Proof of Power, a 50% PoW / 50% PoS algorithm, which solves theoretical weaknesses in other PoS systems, and is provably immune to 51% hash attacks, making Verus one of, if not the most, double-spend resistant public blockchain(s) running. With its groundbreaking consensus protocol, Verus also uses a unique hash algorithm, VerusHash, a quantum secure hash algorithm that is near-equally mineable on both CPUs and GPUs.  The Verus Coin’s project vision includes automatically provisioned public blockchains as a service.  Verus was a no-ICO, no-premine, 100% fairly launched community project.","","100.0","smart contract platform","unknown","7.5","47.57250186264837","93.3542902373069","20.0","1527","0","49.48250158305741","0"

Launching its Mainnet ahead of any other DePIN, XYO specializes in collecting and validating real-world data, bridging it seamlessly to Web3 and Web2 companies across AI, geolocation, and other critical data sectors.
At the core of XYO are Proof of Location and Proof of Origin technologies, enabling accurate validation of real-world data for innovative use cases such as Real-World Asset (RWA) tracking, DePIN applications, real-world gaming, and treasure hunts. Recently, XYO expanded its ecosystem by launching the XYO Layer One blockchain, purpose-built to support the intensive data demands of DePIN, RWA, AI, and similar data-driven industries.
XYO employs a unique dual-token model:
XYO Token: An externally traded token supporting the DePIN ecosystem, rewards, staking, and governance, enhancing overall ecosystem value and scarcity.


XL1 Token: Internal to the XYO Layer One blockchain, facilitating transactions, gas fees, and other blockchain-specific use cases.
The dual-token economics are strategically designed to increase scarcity and promote sustainable growth. The XYO token is available on major exchanges, including Coinbase. The XL1 token will launch publicly later in 2025.
To accelerate network adoption and growth, XYO created the popular COIN app. Beyond the XYO Foundation, the team founded the U.S.-based, for-profit entity XY Labs Inc., notable as the first U.S. crypto company qualified by the SEC for a Regulation A offering, permitting share sales to both accredited and non-accredited investors. XY Labs further stands out as one of the pioneering U.S. companies to tokenize and publicly list its shares. These tokenized shares trade as $XYLB on the tZERO ATS, positioning XY Labs prominently in the growing wave of Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization.

To further strengthen its economic structure, BC.GAME employs a weekly buyback and burn mechanism. A portion of the platform's revenue or reserves is allocated to buy $BC tokens from exchanges or liquidity pools, guided by market conditions, token performance, or strategic objectives. These tokens are then permanently removed from circulation through an automated or manual burn process, executed via smart contracts. This approach reduces supply, fosters scarcity, and enhances the long-term value of the token.","","","gambling (gamblefi)","solana","82.89999999999999","41.56176528274104","0.0","99.55000000000001","879","0","36.675900000000006","0"

Network users are rewarded with the latter when they hold the former, which is also the case with NEO &amp; GAS. The VeChain Token can be used to deploy applications on the platform where as VeThor can be used to pay for applications and other transactions over the network. VeChain claims that this economic model is better suited for enterprises than the one in other blockchains, such as Ethereum and Bitcoin, where higher usage drives the cost of the utility token and subsequently the cost of deploying and operations in the protocol.

In an official blog post earlier this year, the foundation announced it’s “grand aspirations to make financial services sector one of the main focuses on our development plan”. They also announced their partnership with a property mortgage loan provider Fanghuwang.com, a subsidiary of Beijing Baisheng Technology Co., Ltd. They also reported partnerships with BMW, Groupe Renault, and DNV GL.
Until now, VeChain has existed in the form of an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain. In an announcement detailing the roadmap moving forward, the foundation stated that they would engage in negotiations with exchanges to perform the token swap to become an independent network. The roadmap also detailed plans to launch a mobile wallet and ledger integration.","","75.0","layer 1 (l1)","vechain","89.4","44.36204315565618","98.43767900413712","76.7","1397","0","65.434587651448","0"

Non-Playable Coin (NPC) is a meme coin and NFT-hybrid for all 8+ billion humans on Earth. ""I support the current coin"" is the motto, a homage to the meme that first gained in popularity in 2018.

What makes your project unique?
Inspired by the non-playable character meme, NPC leans into the joke by creating an ERC20 token whose supply is the total human population as recorded on July 26, 2023. Each token is also convertible into an NFT at a rate of 1:1. Hence, it is a token with JPEG metadata that is designed to be traded both on decentralized exchanges like Uniswap (as an ERC20) and on NFT marketplaces (as an ERC1155). 

This unique design—an NFT that can also be traded as an ERC20—is called a meme fungible token (MFT). An MFT like Non-Playable Coin (NPC) links two often-separated liquidity markets, while also allowing more people than ever to own a ""part of the culture"" as NFTs. 

On the home page, users can switch between the two formats using the dApp. Users can ""respawn"" as an NFT or ""transform"" into a meme coin. The most liquid form for trading, however, is as an ERC20.

History of your project.
The project started by playing with NFT AMMs like Sudoswap and realizing that ERC1155s were not being used to explore new avenues. We also felt that the 10k+ pfp NFT collection has hit a wall because it is limited both by exclusivity and gas cost. This project seeks to demonstrate that it is possible to scale communities to millions using the ERC1155 standard, and that it is possible to unlock liquidity for such tokens by making them fungible as an ERC20. 

What’s next for your project?
Users will soon be able to accessorize their NPCs using a built-in customization tool and export their creations to be used as profile photos. Additionally, we are constructing new supporting infrastructure to better link the liquidity of ERC20 tokens with ERC1155 tokens, with NPC as the main showcase.

What can your token be used for?
At its core, it is purely a meme coin with no utility and is for entertainment purposes only. ","","60.0","nft","ethereum","63.7","57.810184126829945","0.0","71.0","2087","0","29.567500000000003","0"

In more traditional blockchains, the host provides the food/drinks (i.e resources) for this party. And when the guests arrive, the amount of resources can only accommodate so many people, the portions are small and then everything eventually runs out and the party ends. Think Constellation DAG like a potluck (a party where everyone brings food/drinks). With every added guest (node to the network), the more resources the party has to keep going. This is the nature of Constellation, a distributed system that scales horizontally.

Is Constellation a Blockchain?
Not exactly. Although inspired by the principles of decentralization, many standard blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum face scalability issues. This is why the next, generation of decentralized networks such as Hashgraph, IOTA, and Constellation have turned to DAG.

What is a Microservice?
“Microservices” is an approach to application development in which a large application is built as a suite of modular services. Each module supports a specific business goal and uses a simple, well-defined interface to communicate with other sets of services. Uber, for example, is not a singular app purse. It is a unified app which means it is a single interface that brings together their driver app, their rider app, and their corporate team app.","","89.47","smart contract platform","unknown","82.8","76.51612516095905","94.14368157426007","76.2","1332","0","63.80533855099103","0"

$WOULD stems from memes but transcends them, serving as a trusted long-term wealth vehicle. Born on the Solana (SOL) chain with decentralized Web3 blockchain tech, it's unique.
By a stroke of luck, $WOULD became Elon Musk's favorite meme, and with just one sentence, it was activated. After experiencing a 2600 - fold price increase and a complete turnover of hands, it has built a solid foundation at the bottom. Since then, it has been reborn, surpassing 99% of meme coins and getting past the initial 0 - 1 phase.

Future of $WOULD?
Rather than relying on technology or applications, it depends on the consensus of its holders. Abandoning the typical meme coin PVP (Player vs. Player) approach, $WOULD embraces PVE (Player vs. Environment), making it a refreshing change among meme coins. Among the 99% of coins that eventually become worthless, it's like the ""Crypto Berkshire Hathaway,"" where every holder is a shareholder. Abandon centralized stocks, real estate, and fiat currencies, and embrace cryptocurrencies that you can control, taking your destiny into your own hands.
It is decentralized, non - inflationary, with no marketing and no fake data. It attracts a group of investors who share the same values for long-term value investing. $WOULD is everyone's piggy bank.
Tokenomics
$WOULD is only issued on the SOL chain and not on other chains. Any issuance on other chains is a scam. Supply: Decentralized, CTO now in charge. No Taxes, No Bullshit. It's that simple. LP tokens are burnt, and contract ownership is renounced.
WOULD Mission:
Empower long-term holders to generate profits while incentivizing them to reinvest in WOULD.
WOULD Values:
Integrity and honesty; embracing the philosophy that “slow is fast” by prioritizing health and longevity; striving for value creation beyond mere profit.
WOULD Vision:
To establish itself as the Berkshire Hathaway of cryptocurrency.","","","solana ecosystem","solana","41.5","22.397706381039185","0.0","47.199999999999996","1923","0","23.614125","0"

UMA builds infrastructure for “priceless” financial contracts: DeFi contracts that minimize oracle usage, avoiding many of the security and scalability issues that have plagued decentralized finance. The first contracts built with UMA are priceless synthetic tokens: ERC20 tokens that can track anything while minimizing the need for on-chain price data.

The UMA project token powers the system in two ways:

Governance: UMA token holders govern what types of contracts can access the system, which asset types are supported, and key system parameters and upgrades.

Price requests: the priceless methodology minimizes on-chain price requests but doesn’t eliminate them — when contract interactions are disputed, UMA token holders fulfill price requests via the Data Verification Mechanism, or DVM.

UMA tokens enable the holder to participate in community governance and resolve contract disputes through the DVM. The tokens are not an investment opportunity.","","","decentralized finance (defi)","ethereum","36.6","42.52706006812993","97.20231604548357","20.0","1065","0","50.817160615919256","0"

Ardor provides the blockchain infrastructure for businesses and institutions to leverage the strengths of blockchain technology without having to invest in developing custom blockchain solutions. Instead, Ardor offers a main chain that handles blockchain security and decentralization plus customizable child chains that come ready to use, right out of the box, for various business applications. Ardor goes beyond Nxt to solve critical issues of blockchain bloat, scalability, and customization.

Nxt is a well respected, verified, and established blockchain technology with a comparatively long history and an experienced development team. However, as blockchain usage increases over the coming years Nxt, and other blockchain technologies, will face some fundamental problems with payments, scalability, and customization. The first and most straightforward problem is the use of native tokens for transaction fees. Nxt uses a forging proof of stake system, meaning that the total token supply has already been created and new tokens aren’t created with each block. Instead, the forgers that verify the blocks receive a portion of the transaction fees paid on the network. As such, the transaction fees need to be paid in NXT, even if you’ve created a new currency that’s independent of Nxt, you’ll still need to own NXT in order to pay miners, diluting the value of your own currency. 

To test Ardor’s capabilities and serve as an example of an operating child chain, the Ardor developers have created Ignis. Ignis will implement all of the customizable features that come from the Nxt code base. Essentially, Ignis will be a proof of concept and could be the first of many more child chains on the Ardor platform. The Ignis ICO recently raised $15 million in funding for development. In the future, Ardor child chains could be used to create equity trading platforms, digital file transfer services, private enterprise blockchain applications, and many more use cases. Ardor’s strengths are quick time to setup and wide customizability, making it a great option for companies looking to leverage blockchain without the resources to dedicate to custom development.

Ardor has many architectural advantages. One of them and perhaps the most influential one is that it has been created using Java; one of the most widespread programming languages in the world today. This is definitely a step in the right direction seeing as it becomes ten times easier for a commercial application to succeed if the development language is one which most programmers can relate to.","2018-01-01","","infrastructure","unknown","26.900000000000002","37.99017428421867","72.57415727351322","20.0","2676","2956","54.395855045729625","0"

A primary example is a letter of credit (LOC), analogous to a paper bank cheque drawing verified funds, providing an economic guarantee of payment.

Anvil enables transparency and trustless verification of assets, thereby reducing counterparty risk. The protocol is designed for maximum efficiency and extensibility to incorporate collateral throughout decentralized and traditional finance. 

What can Anvil be used for?
Anvil is a unified protocol for asset provision, designed explicitly for safety, simplicity, and composability as a primitive building block in the development of other applications. 

Payments: LOCs offer security for both online and in-store digital payment transactions.

Counterparty credit: LOCs can be accepted on centralized exchanges to secure instant deposits for immediate trading or more efficient liquidity provision.

Asset bridging: LOCs can facilitate immediate cross-platform transactions. LOCs can also secure deposit or withdrawal transactions on layer 2 (L2) implementations. In instances where a platform integrates Anvil LOCs, immediate, on-demand asset transfers can be safely executed.","","","decentralized finance (defi)","ethereum","6.1","35.60900258685022","0.0","20.0","1250","0","16.80355","0"

It unlocks capital efficiency at scale, auto-balancing allocations based on market conditions while maintaining a conservative risk profile. Spark was created to solve DeFi’s core inefficiencies: fragmented liquidity, unstable yields, and idle stablecoin capital. It acts as a two-sided capital allocator—borrowing from Sky’s $6.5B+ reserves and deploying across DeFi, CeFi, and RWAs to provide deep, consistent liquidity. This yield is packaged into products like sUSDS and sUSDC, offering users programmable, fee-free income. Rather than competing with protocols, Spark powers them as the liquidity and yield infrastructure for onchain finance.

Access to Deep, Scalable Liquidity: Spark taps into Sky’s $6.5B+ stablecoin reserves, enabling large-scale capital deployment across DeFi, CeFi, and RWAs. User-Friendly Yield Products: Yield is delivered through stablecoins like sUSDS and sUSDC—fully composable, fee-free, and available across chains.

SparkLend: A stablecoin lending market. Unlike other lending protocols where rates fluctuate based on utilization or loan size, SparkLend offers governance-defined rates that do not vary based on those factors. This is made possible by Spark’s Liquidity Layer (SLL), which supplies consistent stablecoin liquidity to the protocol.

Spark Savings: A product for earning yield on stablecoins like USDC, and USDS (and soon, USDT) by converting them into yield-bearing sUSDS or sUSDC. These yield tokens are composable with other DeFi protocols, making it easy to put capital to work while maintaining exposure to onchain yield at a competitive risk-adjusted rate.

Spark Liquidity Layer (SLL): A backend capital allocator that routes liquidity to other protocols like Aave, Morpho, and even RWAs (e.g., BlackRock’s BUIDL). One of the most important SLL deployments on Base is the Spark USDC Morpho Vault, which currently supplies $95M USDC, making it the largest liquidity provider to the Coinbase app integration on Base. This vault plays a key role in mitigating rate volatility for borrowers and demonstrates how SLL enhances liquidity conditions across DeFi.

Existing Products: Spark's total TVL is currently $7.9B, split between SparkLend and the Spark Liquidity Layer (SLL). You can find real-time details and breakdowns here: https://defillama.com/protocol/spark#information

Spark in DeFiLlama, https://defillama.com/protocol/spark#information

SparkLend is one of the largest lending protocols in DeFi. It offers deep liquidity and governance-defined rates, providing borrowers with transparent conditions.

Spark Savings is live on Ethereum mainnet, Base, Optimism, Arbitrum, Unichain, and Gnosis, offering vaults for both USDS and USDC.

The Spark Liquidity Layer actively deploys capital across protocols on multiple chains, including Ethereum mainnet, Base, and Arbitrum.

It has both Automated Market Maker (AMM)-based and orderbook-based exchanges. 

zkRollup is an Ethereum L2 scaling solution that migrates computations off the blockchain. Loopring protocol only uses the underlying Ethereum blockchain as a data layer and a verification layer. As a result, Loopring's throughput is as high as 2,025 trades per second compared to Ethereum’s current throughput of 15 transactions per second. The result is that the cost per trade settlement is as small as $0.00015.

Loopring's performance is sufficient for professional traders and market makers to deploy algorithmic strategies and other automated trading bots. This was not previously possible on any DEX as it was prohibitively slow and expensive. By building on top of Loopring 3.0, orderbook-based DEXs can be commercially viable for the first time. Loopring expects non-custodial exchanges can begin to outcompete and displace many centralized counterparts.","2017-08-01","","decentralized exchange (dex)","ethereum","82.0","41.61203055093975","96.89119253321721","65.4","1051","3109","74.70721738662601","0"

Currently deployed on Aptos, Movement, and Initia, it serves as the core capital coordination layer for Move-based DeFi, enabling users to supply assets to earn yield and borrow against collateral through overcollateralized loans.

The protocol offers several core products. The primary lending markets feature variable-rate borrowing with vault-based accounting where depositors passively accrue interest from borrowers. Efficiency Mode (E-Mode), inspired by Aave, enables higher loan-to-value ratios of up to 90% on correlated asset pairs such as stablecoins or liquid staking tokens. Isolated pools provide risk-segregated markets for long-tail assets, preventing contagion to core liquidity. The Fixed Yield product allows users to tokenize, trade, and leverage yield-bearing assets without liquidation risk on the yield component. 

The protocol employs a multi-layered risk architecture including supply and borrow caps per asset, conservative LTV and liquidation thresholds, rate limits on deposits and withdrawals, and an automated liquidation mechanism. Oracle infrastructure is powered by Chainlink as the primary source with Pyth and Switchboard as fallbacks, ensuring tamper-resistant pricing for fair liquidations.

Launched on mainnet in March 2021, Casper provides infrastructure for tokenized assets, featuring upgradable smart contracts, protocol-level access control, and native support for multiple virtual machines (VMs).

The network runs on Zug Consensus, a deterministic protocol offering instant finality that is crucial for financial transactions, regulated assets, and enterprise workflows. Casper is also among the first Layer-1 networks to support multiple VMs running in parallel, allowing applications with different technical needs to operate natively on the same chain without relying on rollups or Layer-2 solutions.

Offering a familiar and modern development environment, Casper prioritizes developer accessibility. Supporting Rust, WebAssembly (WASM), and SDKs in mainstream languages like JavaScript, Python, and Go, Casper enables millions of developers, not just Web3 specialists, to build production-grade blockchain applications without learning obscure or domain-specific tools.","","75.0","smart contract platform","unknown","71.8","41.59773795738515","0.0","92.7","1087","0","34.972625","0"

As many apps experience cross-chain difficulties today, ICON recognizes the frustration regarding the complexity involved with security, scaling and speed in cross-chain environments. Apps use ICON to operate cross-chain seamlessly, build momentum and gain a solid reputation. ICON's Cross-Chain Framework helps to simplify cross-chain development with its easy-to-use xCall General Message Passing and connections to secure bridging protocols. Visit the ICON Community website for an up to date overview of connected blockchains. Check out the documentation and see if your favorite application is compatible with the ICON Cross-Chain Framework! What Makes ICON Unique? The ICON Cross-Chain Framework consists of a robust L1 blockchain, xCall General Message Passing and a growing list of connected blockchains and integrated bridging protocols. ICON's native ICX coin fuels this interoperability by acting as the L1 gas token, xCall cross-chain fee token with associated applications. A sizeable percentage of all these fees collected in ICX are burned. Buying ICX (with fiat) is easy on big centralized exchanges, decentralized exchanges and even in-wallet.

It also supports collaboration amongst chain networks with its various protocol groups.They will constantly provide common modules on the underlying infrastructure for different kinds of distributed scenarios, such as those for the distributed digital identity framework, distributed data exchange protocol, and so on. 

Ontology was created in 2017 by a Chinese company called OnChain, which is led by founders Erik Zhang and Da HongFei. OnChain has had huge success in the cryptocurrency industry, as they were also the founders behind the NEO blockchain, which is now a multi-billion dollar project. Essentially, Ontology was created as a way for businesses of all sizes to install blockchain technology within their company, without having to completely change all of their current systems.

The purpose of the Ontology framework is that it is not intended to operate as a single blockchain. Instead, the technology will allow businesses to make full use of both a private and public blockchain.

- A futures/forward market for gas, enabling the creation of a native Ethereum yield curve.
- Gas abstraction for end users via the Open Gas Initiative, removing gas volatility and shifting costs to protocols.

Paxos was the first virtual currency company to receive a charter from the New York State Department of Financial Services. As a chartered limited purpose trust company with fiduciary powers under the Banking Law, Paxos is able to offer regulated services in the crypto-asset and virtual commodities space.

The Paxos team comes from a wide variety of backgrounds with a diverse array of experiences ranging from Wall Street to Silicon Valley. It’s led by CEO and co-founder Charles Cascarilla, who has spent his career as a customer, analyst, investor and now creator of financial technology.

Paxos describes itself as “the first regulated Trust company with blockchain expertise”, and it is using that expertise to create a modern settlement solution that can eliminate risk and simplify settlements. What many people may not know about Paxos is that it was actually founded in 2012 as Paxos Trust Company, and that for most of its life it ran the cryptocurrency exchange itBit, which is still operates. The creation of Paxos was a pivot from an exchange platform to a company focused on creating a modern settlement platform using blockchain technology.

Paxos has become the most widely adopted cryptocurrency in the fastest time frame, with support from over 20 exchanges and OTC desks in the first five weeks of its existence. It’s been picked up and listed by six of the top ten cryptocurrency exchanges, Binance, OKEx, Gate.io, ZB, KuCoin and DigiFinex. These exchanges are offering PAX as an alternative to the controversial Tether. Unlike the controversy surrounding the people who control Tether, there is no such obscurity when it comes to the people behind Paxos. The CEO and co-founder is Charles Cascarilla. He has over 15 years in financial services and has co-founded Cedar Hill asset management back in 2005. He has also worked and Bank of America and Goldman Sachs prior to that.

The Pax Dollar (USDP) is the first digital asset to be issued by a financial institution and to be fully secured by the U.S. dollar. While other similar stablecoins have existed, there has been no proof of full U.S. dollar reserves, nor have these earlier assets been issued by a financial institution. The Paxos team has been fairly clear in declaring the different base that PAX is working from.

Enjin is a leading blockchain ecosystem dedicated to revolutionizing the gaming industry by integrating blockchain technology into games, applications, and businesses.
Founded in 2009 by Maxim Blagov and Witek Radomski, Enjin began as a community gaming platform of 20 million gamers. Pivoting to blockchain in 2017 and kickstarting the NFT movement, Enjin pioneered the advanced ERC-1155 token standard on Ethereum. Building upon this foundation, Enjin launched the Enjin Platform, the world's first NFT integration platform, allowing developers to seamlessly incorporate blockchain assets into their applications in less than 24 hours.
Enjin has since evolved into a comprehensive suite of blockchain products, with the Enjin Blockchain platform now powering billions of digital assets.
The Enjin Ecosystem
Enjin is a feature-rich ecosystem that covers a wide range of blockchain software products. Enjin’s tools enable developers, businesses, and individuals to create, manage, trade, distribute, and integrate NFTs with ease. Enjin's technology is used to power digital assets by millions of users world-wide.
Enjin Blockchain: A Substrate-based Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain custom-built for Non-Fungible-Tokens (NFTs) and other digital assets. Optimized for gaming, it offers high transaction throughput, low fees, and eco-friendly transactions.
Enjin Wallet: A secure, multi-functional mobile wallet supporting various cryptocurrencies and NFTs, enabling users to manage their digital assets with ease.
NFT.io Marketplace: An intuitive platform for creating, trading, and distributing NFTs, fully integrated with the Enjin Blockchain to provide a seamless user experience.
Enjin Platform API and SDKs: Developer toolkit that facilitate the integration of blockchain assets into games and applications, supporting multiple programming languages and platforms.
Enjin Beam: A QR code-based distribution system that allows for the effortless dissemination of NFTs, enhancing user engagement and marketing strategies.
Enjin Coin (ENJ)
At the core of the Enjin ecosystem is Enjin Coin (ENJ), the native governance and utility token of Enjin Blockchain. ENJ underpins all transactions, asset creation, and economic activity within the ecosystem, playing a crucial role in securing the network and empowering users to create and trade digital assets with real-world value. Key functions:
Governance &amp; Staking: ENJ holders can stake Enjin Coin (ENJ) to participate in network governance, securing the blockchain while earning rewards for their contributions. This decentralized model ensures a fair and community-driven ecosystem.
Transaction Fees: ENJ is used to pay for all transactions on Enjin Blockchain, ensuring a seamless and unified economic model.
Security &amp; Network Validation: ENJ is used in the nominated proof-of-stake (NPoS) consensus mechanism to secure Enjin Blockchain and allows participants to nominate reliable nodes.
NFT Minting &amp; Creation: ENJ is used to mint NFTs and other digital assets, enabling the creation of unique, blockchain-powered items for games, applications, and virtual economies. These NFTs are verifiable, tradeable, and interoperable, allowing seamless integration across multiple platforms.
ENJ-Backed NFTs: Enjin Coin (ENJ) can be used to back NFTs, giving them a provable, on-chain reserve value. When an NFT is created using the Enjin ecosystem, developers can choose to embed ENJ within the asset, ensuring it always holds a base level of value. Holders of these NFTs have the option to melt (destroy) them at any time to recover the underlying ENJ, providing liquidity and tangible worth to digital collectibles, game items, and virtual goods.
Strategic Partnerships and Adoption
Enjin has established meaningful partnerships with leading industry players such as Microsoft, Square Enix, Samsung, and Entropia Universe, in addition to collaborating with over 150 game and app developers. These collaborations span a wide range of genres, including rewards programs, open-world fantasy RPGs, trading card games, augmented reality apps, and Minecraft servers.
Recent Developments
In September 2023, Enjin Blockchain was launched, marking a significant milestone in the ecosystem’s mission to decentralize digital asset ownership. This launch included a ""triple migration"" of tokens and NFTs across Ethereum, Polkadot, and the new Enjin Blockchain, streamlining operations and enhancing the ecosystem's efficiency.
As of May 31, 2024, 95% of Enjin Coin's total supply has been unlocked, reflecting the ecosystem's maturity and widespread adoption.
Vision for the Future
Enjin is committed to making blockchain-powered gaming accessible to everyone. By providing user-friendly tools and services, Enjin empowers developers to create immersive, player-driven economies where digital assets hold real-world value. With a focus on innovation and collaboration, Enjin aims to bring NFTs and blockchain technology to a global audience, transforming the digital landscape.

The token incentivizes and rewards a variety of participants including developers, validators/stakers, investors, and community members who develop, secure and govern the network. In order to use the network, users pay a small transaction fee denominated in the native Harmony token.

Harmony’s scalable, high-throughput protocol is powered by a native token which is used for various forms of payment and participation in the protocol (staking, transaction fees, voting &amp; governance).

Harmony uses blockchain to align incentives of different stakeholders, developers and businesses while allowing them to build open marketplaces of fungible and non-fungible tokens and assets. Furthermore, the upcoming application of zero-knowledge proofs will allow Harmony to become a data sharing platform that can overcome the conflicting problem plaguing many information and data markets: that individual market participants’ have mutual distrust to share data but strong desire to acquire data themselves.

The Harmony token will function in the following aspects of the protocol:

The token is used for staking, which is necessary to participate in the POS consensus &amp; earn block rewards and transaction fees.
The token is used to pay for transaction fees, gas and storage fees.
The token is used in voting for on-chain governance of the protocol.","","50.0","smart contract platform","unknown","88.9","43.744831588744404","98.71738191249939","83.1","1468","0","67.13323366937477","0"

With this new addition, Lagrange now unlocks proofs for anything – for rollups, apps, coprocessors and interoperability – as an infinite proving layer that enables anyone to prove everything at internet scale. Previously, Lagrange launched the first production-ready ZK prover network in the industry, operated by top operators including Coinbase, Kraken, OKX and more. Now, Lagrange’s ZK Prover Network is expanding to address key challenges faced by rollups and advance ZK adoption and utility.

The ZK Coprocessor can generate a proof of correct computation over arbitrary storage slots for arbitrary block ranges. For example, consider an application that wishes to compute the average on Ethereum for ETH / USDC pricing. A developer must first specify the memory slots and block range (~50,400) that they are interested in including in the data set. Next the developer writes the computations that is to be executed across the storage slots over the different blocks in parallel. Once the proof is generated, it will prove both the storage inclusion and the aggregated computation as valid with respect to a block header derived from smart contract information.","","","artificial intelligence (ai)","ethereum","24.4","34.85604462283983","0.0","20.0","1339","0","16.8052","0"

Led by a team of proven founders and backed by $40 million from world-class investors, including Sequoia and Matrix, IOST aims to be the underlying architecture for the future of online services.

The powerful consensus algorithm “Proof-of-Believability” enables next-gen transaction throughput speeds while ensuring nodes stay compliant, using factors including IOST token balance, reputation-based token balance, network contributions and user behaviors. A faster grade Byzantine Fault Tolerance mechanism, microstate blocks, Atomic Commit protocol and a dynamic sharding protocol (Efficient Distributed Sharding) all ensure transactions are safeguarded, consistent and lightning fast while reducing storage, configuration costs and processing power for validators. 

Anyone is able to participate in every layer of our system, from using services on our blockchain to running a node and validating transactions. Our rules and code are open for all to see and no preconditions will limit participation. IOST aims to fundamentally disrupt previous methods of business by creating a self-operated, trustless network that maximizes network value for all parties. The project places great emphasis on decentralized and secure ways of storing information. It also provides for Dapps and smart contracts, and anyone who is familiar with blockchain technology knows just how integral these two concepts have become.

Adhering to the quintessential egalitarian values of blockchain technology, IOST is creating a censorship-resistant and trustless network that is open to all, using blockchain technology to cut out middlemen and maximize network value for all parties. 

Terrace Wang, Kimmy Zhong, and Ray Xiao, who are extremely brilliant, have co-founded the project. In addition to these original three, the project has 12 employees and 4 advisors. It is also worth noting that Ryan Bubiski, a co-founder of CodeAcademy and a winner of Times Most Influential People award plays a major role in the advisory board of the project. The team has partnered with about sixteen blockchain and cryptocurrency oriented companies such as Sequoia, Nirvana Capital, and DFund. The project, therefore, has strong investors.""","2018-01-11","","smart contract platform","binance-smart-chain","88.6","45.45484720152559","97.66877345889752","80.5","2349","2946","78.25262071061414","0"

The network leverages the Avalanche consensus protocol, ensuring high throughput and low-latency transaction finality. Apertum also incorporates an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible architecture, enabling seamless interoperability with Ethereum-based projects and the migration of decentralized applications (dApps) to its platform.
The core of the Apertum ecosystem is driven by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), allowing the community to actively participate in protocol governance. This DAO-driven approach ensures that key decisions regarding the platform’s development, upgrades, and ecosystem management are made collaboratively, prioritizing the needs of the users and developers within the network.
Apertum’s deflationary model is a key feature that distinguishes it from many other blockchains. Transaction fees are partially burned, reducing the overall supply of APTM tokens over time. This deflationary mechanism helps to increase the scarcity of the token, contributing to its value retention and long-term sustainability. The network has a capped total supply of 2.1 billion APTM tokens, with 2 billion tokens mined through periodic halvings, ensuring predictable and controlled inflation.
Since its launch on January 30, 2025, Apertum has seen significant adoption. By Q1 2025, the network surpassed 25,000 unique wallet addresses. The combined trading volume across centralized exchanges (CEX) and decentralized exchanges (DEX) exceeded $2 million per day, a clear indication of growing market interest and liquidity. Additionally, several memecoins launched on the Apertum blockchain have seen liquidity surpassing $200,000, demonstrating the platform’s potential for diverse use cases, including community-driven projects.
The Apertum network also supports smart contract deployment, empowering developers to create and deploy decentralized applications (dApps) across a range of sectors, including finance, gaming, and social platforms. With a focus on scalability and security, Apertum aims to provide a reliable platform for the next generation of digital assets and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.
Looking ahead, Apertum is committed to expanding its ecosystem and improving the interoperability with other blockchain networks. Future upgrades will focus on enhancing transaction throughput, expanding support for cross-chain operations, and further developing the DAO governance model to empower the community.
In summary, Apertum is a scalable, secure, and community-driven Layer 1 blockchain designed to foster innovation in decentralized applications while ensuring long-term sustainability through a deflationary token model.

What makes your project unique?
Whilst we understand that Perpetuals are indeed a major form of innovation in the space, we also recognise that many of such perpetual contracts are being traded on centralised exchanges, many of which may not be transparent with usage of funds. The team is a strong believer of decentralisation and transparency and with the vision of bringing perpetuals on-chain, Fulcrom was born.

History of your project.
Fulcrom Beta went live on 28 Feb and had IDO on VVS Finance on 16 Mar. With a short period of around 1 month, we generated 100M accumulative trading volume with more than 5000 active traders.

What’s next for your project?
Fulcrom is planning to expand our tradable token in pool, further enhance our core product feature with more analytics and visualised data, improving user onboarding journey, as well as hosting trading competition and points system.

What can your token be used for?
FUL is fulcrom native governance token, with FUL, users can earn platform revenue with staking rewards. We are also planning to utilise FUL in the future trading competition and point system

Senior tranche is essentially an over-collateralized, yield-bearing asset that offers minimum guaranteed yield at a benchmark rate and is protected against underlying counterparty credit risk, with coverage provided by the junior tranche. It is designed for risk-averse investors looking for safer, more predictable yields on digital dollars that outperform T-bill rates, Aave lending yield, Sky Savings etc. where conservative capital in DeFi typically resides today.

Junior tranche is a liquid investment product and serves as a market-priced insurance fund that
underwrites underlying strategy’s underperformance against the benchmark rate and
counterparty credit risk. It is well-suited for users with a more aggressive risk profile, including DeFi-native power users, hedge funds, and yield farmers who seek higher yields and have a slightly higher risk tolerance.

Strata’s dual-token design introduces a meaningful shift in risk management by splitting yield and risk exposure into distinct senior and junior tranches. By transforming the underlying yield strategy into risk-tiered tranches, allowing different types of investors to access yield based on their risk appetite, Strata is redefining how on-chain or off-chain yield is accessed, managed, and scaled across DeFi.","","","ethereum ecosystem","ethereum","3.8","49.991419878268026","0.0","20.0","1532","0","16.80865","0"

Its main value proposition is to merge high-production-value gaming with verifiable digital asset ownership, known as the play-to-earn model. The project is an open-world fantasy role-playing game where players capture collectible creatures called Illuvials, which are represented as non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The project's economic model mandates that 100% of the game’s generated revenue is distributed back to those who stake the project's native token.

Illuvium achieves scalability and efficiency by processing the majority of its transactions, including NFT minting and trading, on Immutable X. This is a Layer 2 scaling solution that utilizes Zero-Knowledge Rollups (zk-Rollups), a technology that bundles hundreds of transactions off-chain and sends a cryptographic proof of their validity back to Ethereum. This method allows the game to achieve high speeds and eliminates gas fees for players while maintaining Ethereum's core security. Key features include an interoperable game universe where digital assets are designed to be used across multiple titles, as well as the ability for players to trade assets on the IlluviDex marketplace with zero transaction fees.

The ILV token serves as the primary utility and governance token, allowing holders to participate in the project's Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) to vote on future development and economic policies. Token holders can stake ILV to earn rewards funded by in-game revenue, and a synthetic version of the token is used as in-game currency. The project was co-founded by brothers Kieran and Aaron Warwick, with development backed by early venture capital firms like Delphi Digital and IOSG Ventures. Key partnerships are in place with Immutable X for its core Layer 2 infrastructure and Chainlink for a decentralized oracle used to ensure fair randomization in gameplay.","","100.0","gaming (gamefi)","ethereum","65.8","37.792117533524525","0.0","84.5","1969","0","32.940400000000004","0"

They aim to create an entire ecosystem of linked chains and a virtual spiderweb of endless use-cases that make ARK highly flexible, adaptable, and scalable. ARK is a secure platform designed for mass adoption and will deliver the services that consumers want and developers need. It is fast, decentralized, scalable, collaborative, bridging and open-source. The ARK Desktop Wallet is natively built for all major Operating Systems. ARK wallets connect to fully synced network peers removing the need to download the full blockchain.

ARK operates using a Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus algorithm. Unlike Bitcoin, in which miners with expensive rigs secure network transactions, the ARK network is secured by delegates. There are hundreds of potential delegates, but token holders in the ARK ecosystem continuously vote on who actually gets to be an active, forging delegate. Only 51 delegates make the cut. As a token holder, you’re only allowed to vote for one delegate at a time. The fee to vote/unvote is just 1 ARK, so it’s advantageous to at least vote once for a delegate you support. The more ARK tokens you own, the more powerful your vote.

ARK was launched in February of this year by 27 members spread across the world. With team members located everywhere from California to Bulgaria – the ARK Crew is truly decentralized. The team currently consists of 15 core members. The ARK infrastructure is modeled heavily on that of three older projects: Bitshares, Crypti, and Lisk. In fact, some of the ARK developers were previously developers on some of those projects. Francois-Xavier (FX) Thoorens, the CTO, was a core developer at Lisk in 2016.

Ark Community
A diverse group of people and skill sets, including Full Stack and Web Developers, Network Engineers, Hardware Experts, Money Managers, Musicians, Traders, Social Media Promoters, and Business Owners, uniting to realize a vision shared by 30 members of the ARK Crew. All passionately devoted to collaboration and the development of the ARK ecosystem and community.

Ark Token
Secured by a cryptographic blockchain network similar to Lisk and Crypti, running on a Delegated Proof of Stake Consensus Algorithm developed by Bitshares. ARK DPoS provides a newly adapted voting system and incorporates many improvements over previous DPoS implementations.

SmartBridge
To increase the reach of the ARK platform, ARK bridges together useful and proprietary blockchains through the use of ARK SmartBridges. These SmartBridges allow for communication among validated bridged blockchains with the ability to perform tasks and advanced functions. Through the use of SmartBridges, the ARK Crew is able to connect many popular blockchains and finally create a unifying bond among different ecosystems. As examples, the first blockchains the ARK Crew will bridge are: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Lisk, 3rd Party Anonymous Network Integration, one or more proprietary gaming economy tokens (Codename: A***** [Ticker: A***]), and numerous other bridges connecting new and already existing blockchains in the future. 

Security
Because we understand security is a major point of concern for everyone, cryptographic and security principals are incorporated throughout the entire Development Life Cycle to guarantee a secure core meeting the requirements and expectations of our users. Through continuous risk analysis and internal recurring penetration testing, we provide a system that fulfills the high standards required by this type of environment. 

Privacy
ARK Anonymous Network Integration provides ARK users with optional privacy when sending ARK transactions throughout all of the services developed for the ARK platform. Anonymization services could be potentially provided by a 3rd Party technology integration Partnership.

Self-Sustaining
The ARK Crew has a mission to make blockchain technology easily accessible to consumers​, even to the point where consumers do not know that they are using it. We not only develop the tools bridging the virtual with reality, but also provide the unique services consumers want, understand, and are willing to purchase using ARK. The ARK Crew develops additional platforms and services benefiting from the ARK technology, providing online and offline revenue streams for the ARK Platform, and leading to faster research and development of new and exciting ways to encourage consumer participation, educating them about blockchain technology, while simultaneously adding value to the ARK coin. By incorporating revenue streams into our projects, the ARK Crew can provide even more unique services for user adoption as we grow.","","","layer 1 (l1)","unknown","70.8","37.644360372460454","97.30635571784603","57.199999999999996","4739","0","60.18132450124612","0"

Derive is deployed and operates on Derive Chain, an Ethereum rollup built using the OP stack and is the home of the Derive Protocol. It is a permission-less smart contract platform.

The Derive DAO earns trading fees from the Derive Protocol and gas fees from the Derive Chain, governed by DRV token holders. Trading fees accrue to an insurance fund to foster robustness of the protocol and rollup.

Derive has built an AI-powered trading app built for pro traders. In collaboration with Messari, Derive Pro translates market views into trades. The agent then prepares transactions for users and leverages smart contract wallets to make trades one-click, gasless and chainless. The app will support spot, perps and options trading on Derive, and will also plug in to spot AMMs on L2s like Optimism, Arbitrum and Base.","","40.0","smart contract platform","ethereum","48.3","47.64229185289322","0.0","58.4","940","0","26.390874999999998","0"

It has developed a blockchain-based platform that enables the tracking and trading of energy, flexibility services and environmental commodities. Its goal is to provide the platform for a fully modernised, market-driven grid that offers consumers a choice in their energy while driving the democratisation of power.
Headquartered in Zug, Switzerland, Powerledger operates in more than 10 countries. Powerledger operates on two blockchain layers; the POWR token is issued on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token, and the Powerledger blockchain - a native Solana based blockchain to process energy transactions on a more scalable network. 


The POWR token is an ERC-20 token that acts as a licence required for businesses such as; utilities, renewable energy operators, microgrids, companies committed to 100% renewable energy and property developers to access Powerledger’s platform, and will be able to be used to pay for transactions on the Powerledger blockchain in future. In 2015, 30 countries had reached grid parity, meaning that the price of solar-generated energy was equal to or less than the cost of local retail electricity. Powerledger combines renewable energy and blockchain technology to offer energy solutions that are cheaper and more sustainable than traditional energy alternatives.


Powerledger was founded in 2016 to solve a pressing problem: Energy that comes from solar and wind is intermittent and lacks the steady quality that fossil fuels provide, and this causes problems for the grid.
Powerledger’s approach was to create a highly agile market that could help regulate this intermittency and start to create a transition to a more responsive, distributed network with better storage. Powerledger’s software is used by utilities and large corporations to track, trace, and trade every kilowatt of energy to improve grid stability.

This ensures that the value of YUSD remains stable at $1, independent of market volatility.","","","stablecoins","ethereum","43.8","49.97504948977942","8.379221054976627","58.8","480","0","29.38655236924182","0"

The Resupply stablecoin is backed by other stablecoins that are earning interest on other lending markets.

Designed to maximize yield returns by having the borrow rate always be half the lending rate being earned, half the risk-free rate, or two percent, whichever is greater.

Emissions are designed for long-term sustainability by directing at three groups: the insurance pool, voting incentives, and directly at borrowers.

The revenue that borrowers generate will directly correlate with the emissions directed towards them. The more revenue a borrower generates for Resupply, the greater the share of emissions it will receive.

Targeted platforms for launch are Curve Lend and Fraxlend.","","","stablecoins","ethereum","15.8","49.87254628815081","0.0","20.0","837","0","16.78555","0"

The project introduces a dual-token model with ATONE (used for staking and governance) and PHOTON (used for transaction and IBC fees), ensuring that fee volatility does not compromise network security. AtomOne implements a formal on-chain constitution enforced by multiple DAOs, including the Steering DAO and Oversight DAO, to guarantee transparent governance without reliance on a centralized foundation.

AtomOne is optimized for Interchain Security 1.5 (ICS 1.5), allowing application-specific consumer chains to leverage the security of the AtomOne validator set while retaining sovereignty. The protocol is committed to a fair token distribution, DAO-managed treasuries, and no VC or foundation allocations.

As a modular Cosmos-native blockchain, AtomOne aims to serve as a neutral, secure coordination hub for the broader interchain ecosystem.","","50.0","layer 1 (l1)","unknown","5.3","37.07452908240479","0.0","20.0","1038","0","16.795","0"

Wrapped assets, like cbXRP, are transferable tokens that are redeemable for the underlying asset. Coinbase customers can unwrap cbXRP and redeem a corresponding amount of the underlying XRP simply by depositing the cbXRP into their Coinbase accounts. cbXRP is built to be seamlessly compatible with DeFi applications, giving customers the option to tap into DeFi and unlock financial utility. 
cbXRP removes a key point of friction by allowing customers to use Ripple they already hold in new ways onchain. cbXRP is built to be seamlessly compatible with DeFi applications, so users can now tap into novel DeFi use cases like providing their XRP as liquidity to DeFi protocols, using it as collateral to borrow other crypto assets, or spending it as a payment method. Wrapped assets like cbXRP are a mature concept in the crypto world, helping to bring more liquid assets onchain and facilitate an expansive financial ecosystem.

Convert your $burn tokens into an equivalent amount of $BNB and mint $build tokens as proof.
Assumption:
Burning 1000 $burn tokens worth 1 $BNB will mint 1 $build token as your proof.
Simultaneously, an additional 1 $build token will be minted and distributed to all $build holders [based on $build holdings].
If you are the first to burn $burn tokens worth 1 $BNB, you will receive 1 $build and 1 $build reflection, totaling 2 tokens.
When the second burn, with tokens worth 2 $BNB, occurs, the participant will receive 2 $build proofs and 1 $build reflection. You will also receive 1 $build (as you occupy 50% of the share).
And so on!
-
Claim Rewards:
Reward calculation: Your holdings of $build - Your proof (build) = BNB reward you can claim.
Assuming your initial burn value was 1 $build (proof), when you accumulate 10 $build, you can claim a reward of 9 $BNB!
Regardless of the quantity of your $build proofs, they will be reset to zero when you claim the reward.
Don't claim rewards too easily; leave them for community development.
-

Bancor is an ecosystem of decentralized, open-source protocols that promote on-chain trading and liquidity. 

Its main protocol, Carbon, is a decentralized trading protocol allowing users to perform automated trading strategies using custom on-chain limit orders and range orders, with the option of combining orders together to create automated buy low, sell high strategies. 

Fast Lane, a separate open-source arbitrage protocol, allows any user to perform arbitrage between Bancor ecosystem protocols and external on-chain exchanges and redirect arbitrage profits back to the Bancor ecosystem.

All Bancor ecosystem protocols are governed by the BancorDAO via staked BNT.

What makes Bancor Unique?
Bancor’s flagship protocol, Carbon, allows users to perform automated trading strategies on-chain with far greater control and efficiency compared to existing decentralized exchanges (DEXs).

Existing on-chain liquidity solutions suffer from key drawbacks, namely that: 1) executed orders can be reversed when prices move, and 2) a single liquidity position must execute both buys and sells using the same pricing curve. As a result, on-chain liquidity is costly and complex to automate and update, while exposing traders to MEV sandwich attacks.

Carbon introduces a new form of on-chain liquidity called Asymmetric Liquidity, which allows users to create individual liquidity positions with two distinct pricing curves: one for buying and one for selling. This gives users the ability to set buy and sell orders that execute in specific price ranges, with the option of combining orders together to create automated buy low, sell high strategies. By design, Carbon orders are irreversible on execution, easily adjustable directly on-chain, and completely resistant to MEV sandwich attacks. These capabilities give users an unprecedented level of control and automation to perform novel trading strategies on-chain.

For example, a user who believes ETH will trade in the near future between $1500-2000 could set a Carbon strategy that automatically buys ETH between $1500-1600 and sells the ETH from $1900-2000. As market prices move into selected ranges, orders are automatically executed by traders who interact with Carbon directly, or via popular DEX aggregators. All with no reliance on external oracles or keepers. Strategy updates can be made in a highly gas efficient manner, without needing to withdraw and re-add liquidity, via parameters in a strategy’s smart contract.

Carbon also improves on the trading model in centralized exchanges by allowing users to create multi-order strategies that utilize a single source of rotating liquidity to fill trades, eliminating the need to create multiple limit orders and pre-fund each order as it is created.
By fusing the feature-rich trading functionality of centralized exchanges with the access and transparency of automated market-makers, Carbon unlocks the future of decentralized on-chain trading.

History of Bancor
Bancor invented the first blockchain-based automated market maker (AMM) in 2017. The protocol’s first version was launched in June 2017, with subsequent protocol versions iterating on the original AMM model.

In 2020, the BancorDAO was launched to oversee and govern development of Bancor ecosystem protocols. The BancorDAO has since voted on over 450 governance proposals, and has had at the time writing over 9,700 governance token holders, and over 1,100 voters.

What’s Next for Bancor
Per the BancorDAO, the Bancor community is focused on development of its flagship protocols, Carbon and Fast Lane. The beta version of Fast Lane is currently live on Ethereum mainnet, and will continue evolving, while the beta version of Carbon is expected to go live on Ethereum mainnet in the second quarter of 2023, pending voting by the BancorDAO. From there, deployment of both Carbon and Fast Lane on other Layer-1 and Layer-2 blockchains will be explored. 

The Bancor community will continue executing on its mission to build innovative solutions that expand the design space for on-chain trading and liquidity and open the doors to a wide range of future DeFi applications and products.

What Can Bancor (BNT) Be Used For
The Bancor Network Token (BNT) can currently be staked for vBNT to vote in BancorDAO governance, with additional BNT utility controlled by the BancorDAO.

In Nirvana, value is not arbitrary; it’s programmed.

Its native token, ANA, is backed by protocol-owned USDC reserves. This gives ANA a mathematically assured floor price that can rise but never fall. The immutable exit liquidity is hardcoded into the smart contract itself, removing the need for external market makers. The result is a system for trustless and permanent value storage.

ANA is powered by an Assured Value Machine (AVM), a programmatic market maker which ensures that every token in circulation can always be redeemed for at least its floor price, verifying that the floor price is cryptographically and economically impenetrable.

Because its minimum value is mathematically verifiable, staked ANA can be used as collateral for loans with zero liquidation risk. ANA stakers also earn a share of protocol revenue, which means loans are effectively self-repaying.

Nirvana's expansion, Samsara, is the home of datTokens—on-chain Digital Asset Treasuries.

datTokens work similarly to DAT companies such as MicroStrategy, but they’re on-chain, fair, and have built-in price protection. Each datToken has redeemable value from its underlying reserve, and offers structural price asymmetry against its reserve asset: magnified upside potential and mathematically limited downside risk. datTokens also offer inerest-free loans with no liquidation risk.","","","crypto-backed tokens","solana","35.0","48.076071084925914","0.0","49.8","1492","0","24.257900000000003","0"

peaq is a layer-1 blockchain powering the Machine Economy. It is designed to power Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePINs) and the billions of devices, robots and vehicles (RWAs) that run on them. At the time of launch, peaq is home to over 50 DePINs in 20+ industries. 

What is DePIN? 
Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) is the name for decentralized applications that use tokens to incentivise communities to build physical infrastructure networks (think mobility, electric vehicle charging, telecoms etc.) from the ground up.

More on DePIN: https://www.peaq.network/blog/what-are-decentralized-physical-infrastructure-networks-depin 

Why do DePINs build on peaq?
peaq is designed to power real-world Web3 applications. peaq’s Modular DePIN Functions — which include Machine IDs and DePIN Data Verification — work as building blocks DePINs leverage to speed up their development and deployment. 

peaq’s DePIN ecosystem enables DePINs to explore synergies with peers, peaq’s DePIN-focused enterprise ecosystem gives DePINs opportunities to expand their demand side, and peaq’s fundamentals give them affordable and fast transactions as well as a high degree of decentralization.

Stratis significantly simplifies the development process for creating Blockchain applications and accelerates the lifecycle for Blockchain development projects. Stratis private chain allows businesses to deploy their own customise blockchain without the costs of running their own blockchain network infrastructure.

The vision of the Stratis platform is to become a one-stop shop for all blockchain things, mostly becoming a blockchain-as-a-service (BAAS) platform. Technology-wise, it is a clone of Bitcoin’s core code, with a few enhanced features and written in C# language instead of C++.

The team is based in the United Kingdom but has a decentralized structure with members spreading across the world. Several people on their management team are well-versed in enterprise software development using .NET and C# – a positive sign considering those are the project’s two primary languages. Chris Trew, the founder and CEO, has over 10 years of experience in enterprise IT and was a volunteer developer for the Blitz project. Stratis is competing against other BaaS projects in an increasingly saturated but gigantic space. Lisk may be the largest direct competitor in offering sidechains for businesses. However, Lisk is written in Javascript (not C#) and has sidechains that are more publicly available. The decreased privacy may be a turnoff to corporations looking to keep their code proprietary. The company held an ICO in June 2016 and manage to raised 915 Bitcoin.","2016-08-09","","smart contract platform","unknown","28.599999999999998","40.959773493006594","90.36060767814057","20.0","1704","3466","61.412862687349204","0"

t is used as an incentive to correctly decentralize the Tokamak Plasma Chain. The service operator must deposit TON to open the Plasma Chain. If the chain properly runs, this deposit will gradually increase. However, if there is a technical issue in the chain and someone who finds problem raises an issue, and then, the deposit as a reward will go to that person (challenger).

Moreover, TON is also used to charge Stamina, which is the transaction fee in Plasma Chain. The stamina will be recharged after a certain period.

It has a number of uses including purchasing resources, collateralizing nodes and fuelling transactions on FluxOS, as well as rewarding both miners and FluxNode operators for providing computational resources.

The Flux ecosystem is devoted to empowering everyone to develop, deploy and use the decentralized Internet of the future: Web3.

At this moment, the Flux ecosystem consists of: a native, mineable PoW cryptocurrency ($FLUX); the powerful decentralized computational Flux Network (FluxNodes); a Linux-based operating system (FluxOS); the Flux blockchain, which enables on-chain governance, economics, and parallel assets for interoperability with other blockchains and DeFi access; and finally, the Flux products — FluxAI, FluxCloud, FluxEdge, Zelcore Wallet, the SSP multisig browser wallet, and FusionX, the ultimate swap aggregator.

Currently (2025/5) Flux has a computational network consisting of around 11,500 decentralized nodes, distributed globally with more than 96,000 CPU cores, 230 terabytes of RAM and over 6.1 petabytes of storage. That makes FluxCloud the largest decentralized network in the world!","","80.0","artificial intelligence (ai)","unknown","74.7","41.13788497063757","89.18297720768098","79.4","1190","0","62.86534202268834","0"

Simply put, ABEYCHAIN got there before Ethereum.

Most blockchains use single consensual mechanisms like proof of work or proof of stake. ABEYCHAIN blockchain uses a double consensus mechanism by implementing a secure proof of work and delegated proof of stake hybrid consensus. This hybridization helps to solve an issue commonly known as the “Impossible Triangle.” The triangle consists of a high degree of decentralization, security, and efficiency.

ABEYCHAIN provides a solution to this for users of the blockchain. Creating an ecosystem where users can count on high-speed transactions, cross-chain interoperability, and a growing base of decentralized applications in a fast-expanding ecosystem.

It is an Ethereum ERC20 token that is pegged to $1 USD — every Dai is worth $1, and will always be worth $1, regardless of how much Dai is in existence. There is no centralized authority like Tether that backs its value, and no traditional bank that backs each Dai with a real US dollar. There is nothing that can be shut down, and no centralized authority that needs to be trusted. Dai lives entirely within the Ethereum blockchain using smart contracts.

*Features of Dai:
1. Dai is always worth $1 USD each
2. It can be freely traded like any other ERC20 token
3. Anyone with an Ethereum wallet can own, accept, and transfer it
4. It can be exchanged without any middleman
5. No individual person or company has control over it
6. No government or authority can shut it down

*How Dai Works?
Dai is a masterpiece of game theory that carefully balances economic incentives in the pursuit of one goal — a token that is continuously approaching the value of $1 USD.

When Dai is worth above $1, mechanisms work to decrease the price. When Dai is worth below $1, mechanisms work to increase the price. The rational actors that take part in these mechanisms do so because they earn money anytime Dai is not perfectly worth $1. This is why Dai is always floating slightly above or below $1 — it is an endless wave function bouncing infinitely close to $1, but never quite achieving it. The farther Dai goes from $1, the more incentive there is to fix it. This is the magic of Dai.

*How is Dai Created?
Dai is simply a loan against Ethereum. By using the MakerDAO dApp, advanced users can take loans out in Dai against their ETH holdings.

First, ETH is turned into “wrapped ETH” (WETH), which is simply an ERC20 wrapping around ETH. This “tokenizes” ETH so it can be used like any other ERC20 token. Next, WETH is turned into “pooled ETH” (PETH), which means it joins a large pool of Ethereum that is the collateral for all Dai created. Once you have PETH, you can create a “collateralized debt position” (CDP), which locks up your PETH and allows you to draw Dai against your collateral, which is PETH. As you draw out Dai, the ratio of debt in the CDP increases. There is a debt limit that sets a maximum amount of Dai you can draw against your CDP. Once you have Dai, you can spend or trade it freely like any other ERC20 token.

*There are several important reasons why you would create Dai, despite the hassle:

1. You need a loan, and have an asset (ETH) to use as collateral for your loan

2. You believe ETH is going up in value. You can use your CDP to buy ETH on margin — you lock up your ETH in a CDP, draw Dai against it, use the Dai to buy more ETH on an exchange, and then use that ETH to further increase the size of your CDP. This can be accomplished without any third-party or centralized authority allowing you to do so — margin trading can be accomplished entirely on the blockchain.

3. The demand for Dai has driven the price above $1 USD. When this occurs, you can create Dai then immediately sell it on an exchange for greater than $1 USD.

Palladium Network (ticker: PLLD) is a pioneering project that merges the transparency and efficiency of blockchain technology with the tangible value of real-world assets. Operating as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain, PLLD is designed to empower users through real asset backing, decentralized finance (DeFi) integrations, and tokenized ownership models.

At its core, PLLD aims to create a robust digital ecosystem where token holders are not just passive investors but active participants in a growing asset-based economy. The project’s roadmap includes real estate acquisitions, tokenized property NFTs, and community-governed treasury strategies. Its approach emphasizes long-term sustainability, real-world utility, and trustless transparency.

One of the core features of the Palladium Network is its use of acquired physical assets—such as real estate—to back and support the value of its token. The project has already secured its first property: a scenic mountain cottage near a ski resort, which is in the process of being tokenized and offered to the community in fractional NFT format. This real-world linkage provides a degree of intrinsic value to PLLD, setting it apart from purely speculative crypto assets.

PLLD also incentivizes its community through loyalty rewards, staking systems, and regular airdrops for long-term holders. These mechanics are designed to reward true believers in the ecosystem, discourage short-term speculation, and build a resilient token economy. As the treasury grows and more assets are added to the portfolio, the value proposition of holding PLLD becomes increasingly attractive.

The team behind Palladium Network brings a combination of experience in crypto markets, real estate, and technology, working with transparency and dedication to sustainable growth. The project's presence on platforms like TradeOgre and CoinPaprika, along with its ongoing efforts to expand listings and ecosystem partnerships, reflect its commitment to wider adoption.

With a clear vision, a focus on real-world utility, and a commitment to long-term value, Palladium Network offers an innovative and grounded approach to blockchain finance. Whether you're an investor seeking asset-backed exposure, a community member interested in tokenized ownership, or a DeFi enthusiast looking for real utility—PLLD provides a compelling and future-forward opportunity in the crypto space.","","100.0","ethereum ecosystem","ethereum","7.000000000000001","52.35227681865854","0.0","20.0","2511","0","16.8196","0"

Kyber Network is a hub of liquidity protocols that aggregates liquidity from various sources to provide secure and instant transactions on any decentralized application (DApp). The main goal of Kyber Network is to enable DeFi DApps, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and other users easy access to liquidity pools that provide the best rates.

All transactions on Kyber are on-chain, which means they can be easily verified using any Ethereum block explorer. Projects can build on top of Kyber to utilize all the services offered by the protocol, such as the instant settlement of tokens, liquidity aggregation, and a customizable business model.

Kyber looks to solve the liquidity issue in the decentralized finance (DeFi) industry by allowing developers to build products and services without having to worry about liquidity for different needs. 

The Kyber Network Crystal (KNC) token is a utility token that is the ""glue that connects different stakeholders in Kyber's ecosystem."" KNC holders can stake their tokens in the KyberDAO to help govern the platform and vote on important proposals — and earn staking rewards in Ethereum (ETH) that come from trading fees. 

What Makes Kyber Network Unique?
Kyber Network is the first tool that allows anyone to instantly swap tokens without the need of a third-party, like a centralized exchange. The unique architecture of Kyber is designed to be developer-friendly, which enables the protocol to be easily integrated with apps and other blockchain-based protocols.

DeFi has many use cases and possibilities. Therefore, no single liquidity protocol can fit the needs of all liquidity providers, takers, and other market participants. Kyber’s liquidity hub architecture allows developers and the Kyber team to rapidly innovate and integrate new protocols into the overall Kyber Network to cater to different liquidity needs.

In April 2021, Kyber launched the Kyber DMM, the world’s first dynamic market maker protocol (DMM). Kyber DMM is a next-generation AMM designed to react to market conditions to optimise fees, maximise earnings, and enable extremely high capital efficiency for liquidity providers, especially for stable pairs with low variability in price range (like USDC/USDT, ETH/SETH). They will be able to support pools with extremely high amplification factors, which means given the same liquidity pool and trade size, slippage can be 100x (or more) better than typical AMMs. Depending on their amplification strategy, liquidity providers can maximise the use of their capital and have the opportunity to earn much more fees relative to their contribution size, while takers can enjoy extremely low slippage on their trades.

Kyber DMM is the first of many new liquidity protocols that will be launched on the Kyber 3.0 Liquidity Hub.

In the Kyber ecosystem, KNC token holders play an important role in deciding new growth and value-capture opportunities and incentive mechanisms. Through KyberDAO, KNC holders can participate in the governance of the network by voting on important proposals. Kyber’s community is sizable and made up of a wide range of developers, in addition to other members of the blossoming DeFi industry.

Kyber’s fully on-chain design enables the protocol to maintain full transparency and verifiability. The platform claims to be the most used liquidity hub in the world.

How Is the Kyber Network Secured?
As an ERC-20 token, Kyber is built on top of and secured by the Ethereum blockchain. In addition, Kyber uses an extensive trust and security model that protects users from misbehaving administrators or exchanges, thanks to security measures built in both at the protocol and smart contract level.

The platform has been audited by several third-party security firms and researchers, including Chainsecurity, which have determined that the protocol is secure and hence free of vulnerabilities.","","0.0","decentralized exchange (dex)","ethereum","85.0","43.6596958775076","97.78103296210345","82.0","3942","0","66.5466365367362","0"

Since then, USTC has been a freely traded digital asset, with its price determined purely by market supply and demand. It no longer functions as a stablecoin, nor does it have an active peg-maintenance mechanism.

USTC remains an integral part of the Terra Classic ecosystem, where it continues to be used for various purposes, including DeFi applications , gas fees and trading. Unlike traditional fiat-backed assets, USTC’s value fluctuates based on market conditions and community participation.","","100.0","stablecoins","terra","30.3","40.779905542456184","92.05770969413201","20.0","871","0","49.007998392946206","0"

Every coin in Ergo is protected by  a program in Ergo Script, which is a powerful and protocol-friendly scripting language based on Σ-protocols. Using ErgoScript, users can encode the conditions under which coins may be used: who can spend them, when, under what external conditions, to whom, and so on. Extended support for light nodes makes Ergo friendly for end users because it allows running contracts on untrusted commodity hardware.To be usable in the long-term, Ergo follows a survivability approach – it uses widely-researched solutions that do not result in security issues in the future, while also preventing performance degradation over time with a new economic model. Finally, Ergo has a self-amendable protocol that allows it to absorb new ideas and improve itself in the future.","","33.33","smart contract platform","unknown","73.2","43.48061197682205","97.4853699719564","82.5","1110","0","66.54332949018475","0"

QANplatform, the quantum-resistant hybrid blockchain platform enables developers and enterprises to rapidly build software applications like DApps or DeFi and run business processes on blockchain. A blockchain platform, like QANplatform is the basic infrastructure of all blockchain projects and applications. It is like the operating system on a computer. The whole ecosystem can only build and work on top of it. Connect it with real-world data, run automated smart contracts, build decentralized applications (DApps). According to HFS Research excerpt for IBM: Enterprise blockchain adoption is going through a “90-9-1” adoption challenge. 90% of companies are still trying to internalize the concept and its relevant impact. 9% of enterprises that identified relevant use cases are struggling to start with their PoCs and pilots. The 1% of enterprises that have successful pilots are challenged with scalability to a production-grade environment. To achieve blockchain mass adoption Qanplatform focused on these challenges. They built a lot of automation and integration to help freelance developers, blockchain development companies and enterprises start their blockchain PoCs (Proof-of-Concept) as fast as possible. It takes less than 5 minutes to deploy the QAN private blockchain to a preferred cloud platform and start building on it. 

Who Are the Founders of QANplatform ? 

Johann Polecsak, QAN's Chief Technology Officer is also an economist. He along with the Business Development team pursues the way to make QAN as appealing as possible. In the end all what matters is market share. His laser focus lights in the single direction of eliminating any obstacles which could come up as a reason not to implement Blockchain technology, making QAN the only sane choice to work with. Endre Abraham (Silur), QAN's Head of Cryptology contributed to several blockchain projects like Ethereum, Zcash, or Monero. Gaining such an extensive experience could only lead him in one direction: Building a blockchain which solves the pain points of the existing mainstream ones.

What Makes QANplatform Unique? 

QANplatform solves the problems enterprises and developers face when using currently available blockchain by building a platform from scratch that does not require them to make compromises:

    - Hybrid blockchain platform
    - 80% faster implementation than other blockchains
    - Lowest hardware and energy requirements on the market
    - Predictable data transaction prices for public blockchains
    - Enterprise-ready transaction speed
    - Quantum-resistant security

Steem was inspired from the success of Reddit where the community helped enrich the shareholders. Steem aims to help distribute the rewards to the community members who help create the community in the first place. Steem aims to provide various services to its members such as a source of curated news, Q&amp;A, job boards etc. The founders of Steem came from BitShares with Dan Larimer involved as well.

Steem’s main platform, called Steemit, is a social media network built on top of the Steem blockchain. Steemit is similar to popular content-driven social networks like Reddit and Medium, but it rewards users with cryptocurrency for their participation. Fundamentally, the more value a particular piece of content provides to a greater number of people, the more the individuals responsible for creating and curating that content can earn.

Users cast votes, creating a hierarchy of content. The more upvotes a post gets, the more it will earn. The platform also allows for downvotes, giving participants more flexibility when it comes to rating content. Steemit is meritocratic, meaning users that hold more currency can cast votes with greater influence.

The Steemit community even has another service to offer to its customers. D.tube, which is considered to be very similar to YouTube, is Blockchain based and the users can realize the difference between the traditional video publishing websites and D.tube, as the amount of money earned is also displayed beside the post apart from likes shares and comments. The Steemit community is accused of posting plagiarize contents on their publishing website. The irony seems to be reaching highest levels when the original content doesn’t receive much appreciation and income than the copied versions of it.""","2016-03-24","50.0","socialfi","unknown","38.9","40.50421313475523","99.22282755256875","20.0","1891","3604","64.59098964339907","0"

The Chainflip protocol allows users to swap assets between major blockchains without any wrapped tokens, traditional bridging, and at extremely competitive pricing using a novel and unique ‘Just-inTime’ based Automated Market Maker, dubbed the JIT AMM. It is totally generalised, decentralised, and can be integrated with any chain using any transaction type. The protocol is secured by a set of 150 validators staking Chainflip’s native FLIP token. FLIP is primarily a utility token. Validators require FLIP in order to stake, and in turn are rewarded in FLIP. Value is returned indirectly to Validators through protocol fees. Additionally, every swap conducted on the platform results in the automatic buying and burning of FLIP tokens through the liquidity pool system, which puts deflationary pressure on the network as trading volume increases.","","100.0","decentralized finance (defi)","ethereum","52.0","56.60514224936326","0.0","81.89999999999999","1055","0","32.270900000000005","0"

TPT is a fully circulating token with a long-term deflationary model. Starting from July 1, 2025, the TokenPocket Foundation plans to implement a biannual buyback and burn program for TPT, aiming to reduce its total supply from 3.466 billion to 1 billion tokens.","","","bnb chain ecosystem","binance-smart-chain","52.7","43.426549269274346","0.0","88.6","1082","0","33.947325","0"

Metis: A Multi-Network Ecosystem Redefining Decentralized Infrastructure​
Metis is more than a Layer 2 - it is a multi-network ecosystem powered by the groundbreaking MetisSDK. Metis is building the future of decentralized infrastructure with a dual-network architecture: Andromeda for secure, general-purpose dApps and Hyperion for high-performance, AI-optimized execution. Both chains interoperate seamlessly, enabling builders to deploy scalable, efficient, and intelligent Web3 applications across sectors such as DeFi, gaming, DEPIN and AI.

What Is Andromeda ?
Andromeda​​ serves as the foundational optimistic rollup network within the Metis ecosystem, delivering scalable decentralized infrastructure with Ethereum-level security and enhanced throughput. Optimized for DeFi, gaming, and general-purpose applications, it leverages a decentralized sequencer network and fraud-proof mechanisms to prioritize reliability and proven execution over extreme performance. Its battle-tested architecture supports a growing ecosystem of protocols requiring robust security models.

Andromeda will evolve alongside Hyperion, maintaining its core focus on secure general-purpose infrastructure. Key upgrades like on-chain data availability and fraud-proof refinements will advance its capabilities, with a roadmap targeting Stage 0 deployment soon and Stage 1 completion by year-end. As Metis’ cornerstone network, it remains the go-to solution for projects valuing decentralization (via full DSEQ nodes) and time-tested security frameworks.


What Is Hyperion ?
Hyperion：The First Layer 2 Bringing On-Chain LLMs to Life
Hyperion is a high-performance, AI-optimized Layer 2 solution designed to scale AI, DeFi, Depin and gaming applications.

Cartesi enables developers to build appchain rollups with any code, while benefiting from the security of Ethereum. It bridges the gap between traditional software and blockchain by bringing decades of mature operating systems, programming languages, libraries, and tools to decentralized applications.

Cartesi aims to provide the technological foundation from which builders, entrepreneurs, and projects will develop decentralized applications. The Cartesi technology suite is currently comprised of:

Cartesi Rollups: Cartesi Rollups is an app-specific execution environment that can be deployed as a L2, L3, or as sovereign rollups. The combination of an Optimistic Rollups framework and the Cartesi Machine Emulator enables the development of smart contracts and dApps using any package or library that is available for Linux. This allows developers to break free from the scalability limitations of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), and brings the rise of a new blockchain era to handle real-life and complex use cases.

Cartesi Machine: A RISC-V-based virtual machine (altVM) running Linux OS, enabling complex computations and seamless dApp development by expanding the design space and leveraging 40 years of software programming advancements.

CartesiScan: Cartesiscan is the explorer used for viewing blockchain transactions on Cartesi appchain rollups.

Cartesi Explorer: The Cartesi Explorer is a product that allows CTSI users to interact with the governance system and stake CTSI.

Fraud Proof System - DAVE (following PRT): Dave is a permissionless, interactive fraud-proof system. Cartesi’s algorithm further optimizes the fraud proof mechanism to achieve the best balance between security, decentralization, and activity.

What Makes Cartesi Unique

The infrastructure of the internet took 40 years, billions of hours of work, and trillions of dollars to build. With Cartesi, developers gain access to these decades of meticulously refined operating systems, programming languages, software libraries, and tools, paving the way for the next generation of blockchain applications.

Cartesi empowers Ethereum rollups with real-world software and strong guarantees.

Cartesi designed its own Optimistic Rollups framework embedding its own non-EVM virtual machine based on RISC-V.

Leverage decades‑proven software ecosystems: The Cartesi Machine enables full Linux and RISC‑V stack execution in a composable, verifiable rollup environment.

Cartesi’s architecture is optimized for app‑specific rollups, providing scalable and secure chains tailored to each dApp’s needs, backed by a state-of-the-art fraud proof system, properly categorized as Stage-2 according to L2BEAT.

Token Utility

Governance: CTSI holders can currently stake their tokens to earn rewards and participate in ecosystem governance. 

Validator Marketplace: Applications built on Cartesi need validators to monitor and ensure the trustworthiness of transactions. The Validator Marketplace is a decentralized matchmaking service that connects applications with validation service providers. The Validator Marketplace will leverage the CTSI token as a primary means of incentivization in three important ways:

1. Validators will be required to stake CTSI in order to participate, ensuring performance and honest behavior.

2. CTSI holders will be able to delegate their CTSI to experienced validators, allowing tokenholders to share in validation fees without running their own nodes.

3. Token holders can use their CTSI to “buy” a stake in a dApp’s future growth, signaling support for dApps they believe will succeed. The earlier a backer “gets in” on a dApp, the more they are rewarded as that dApp gains traction.

The Validator Marketplace creates a direct link between Cartesi dApp usage and CTSI token demand, enabling token holders to share in the growth and success of the ecosystem.","","","infrastructure","ethereum","81.10000000000001","47.517087149419716","92.24059162805254","88.0","3942","0","66.10748206981839","0"

GPT’s architecture supports a streamlined user experience, targeting reduced gas fees and improved transaction times.

Beyond traditional trading functions, GPT serves multiple use cases. It integrates with gaming ecosystems and e-commerce platforms, allowing holders to utilize the token for in-game purchases and online transactions. Additionally, GPT supports staking mechanisms that reward participants for securing the network. As Gold Park expands, new functionalities—such as governance features—are expected to further involve the community in decision-making processes, thereby fostering a more participatory environment.

GPT’s adaptability makes it viable for users seeking a versatile digital asset. Besides facilitating smooth swaps, it underpins a variety of activities, including digital payments, utility bill settlements, and even physical gold exchanges. This broad applicability positions GPT as a flexible medium of exchange, aligned with Gold Park’s vision to accommodate both everyday needs and specialized use cases.

How Many GPT Are in Circulation?

Gold Park introduced GPT with an initial circulation of 9,000,000,000 tokens. This figure reflects the total amount available at launch on 14/11/2024. Distribution strategies and community incentives, such as staking rewards, are expected to impact how tokens move within the ecosystem over time. While the project’s whitepaper outlines the foundational allocation, additional details about lock-up periods or token burns may be revealed in future updates.

The development team emphasizes transparency by regularly sharing progress through official channels and community discussions. As Gold Park’s roadmap advances, GPT’s role as a medium for payments, staking, and governance could broaden, potentially driving changes in the token’s distribution. By ensuring ongoing communication and incorporating community feedback, Gold Park seeks to maintain a sustainable supply model that underpins continued network growth.","","","bnb chain ecosystem","binance-smart-chain","43.2","31.685397228842188","0.0","77.3","3910","0","31.148049999999998","0"

One of the goals of QuarkChain is to utilize sharding technology to deliver over 1 million transactions per second (tps). Essentially, QuarkChain markets itself as a peer-to-peer blockchain with a high capacity throughput to help deliver fast and secure decentralized applications. The team behind QuarkChain created this blockchain to resolve the issue of scalability that all the major blockchains are currently facing. The team feels that because of the urgency of this issue, the Bitcoin community simply cannot afford to wait until they all agree on a solution. Instead, they feel that by offering different solutions, such as the one inherent in QuarkChain, this compels the community to split via a hard fork and find the solution that works best.

QuarkChain encourages increased decentralization through multiple cheap nodes that then create a cluster that works as a super-full node. This prevents the high expenses associated with super-full nodes when the tps gets high. In terms of protection, all transactions within QuarkChain get the protection of 50 percent of the network’s hash power. This makes a double-spending attack incredibly challenging, particularly when combined with QuarkChain’s decentralized nature.

QuarkChain relies on a two-layer blockchain structure. Sharding blockchains known as shards are the first layer, while the second layer is a root blockchain that confirms the shards’ blocks.The major work on QuarkChain began in Q2 2017 with research into the problem of blockchain scalability. In Q4 of that year, the team drafted the whitepaper. In February 2018, it released the white paper and completed verification code 0.1. March 2018 saw the 0.1 versions of both the wallet and testnet. Now in Q2, the team is working on the testnet 1.0 and smart contract 0.1. In Q4 2018, the team will have the QuarkChain Core 1.0, along with the mainnet 1.0 and the SmartWallet 1.0. By Q2 2019, both the SmartWallet and QuarkChain Core will be in their 2.0 versions.

QuarkChain is a decentralized blockchain network that aims to resolve the issues of scalability that plague existing networks by using sharding technology. In this way, QuarkChain can dramatically extend the usefulness of blockchain technology since many applications are limited by the scalability of existing blockchain networks. The project is still in progress, but QuarkChain has already made many positive steps and already began invite-based beta testing for the testnet, showing significant progress and potential.

The main features of Quarkchain are:

1. Reshardable two-layered blockchain: Quarkchain consists of two layers of blockchains. We apply elastic sharding blockchains (shards) as the first layer, and a root blockchain as the second layer that confirms the blocks from the first layer. The second layer that confirms the blocks from the first layer. The second layer is flexible to be resharded as needed without changing the root layer.

2. Guaranteed security by market-driven collaborative mining: To ensure the security of all transactions, a game-theoretic framework is designed for incentives, where at least 50% of overall hash powers are allocated to the root chain to prevent double spending attack on any transactions.

3. Anti-centralized horizontal scalability: In any blockchain network with a high TPS, a super-full node can be extremely expensive, which encourages centralization. In contrast, QuarkChain allows multiple cheap nodes forming a cluster to replace a super-full node.

4. Efficient cross-shard transactions: Cross-shard transactions in QuarkChain can be issued at any time, and confirmed in minutes. The speed of cross-shard transactions increases linearly as the number of shards increases.

5. Simple account management: There is only one account needed for the entire blockchain (shards) in QuarkChain. All cryptocurrencies from different shards are stored in one smart wallet.","","66.67","infrastructure","ethereum","81.39999999999999","41.79140905273186","96.14518853683312","79.3","4021","0","65.29931598789159","0"

Chromia is an open source public blockchain conceived of by Swedish company Chromaway AB. The Chroma token (CHR) was launched in May of 2019. The technology behind the Chromia blockchain is adapted from an earlier technology called ‘Postchain’, a solution provided by Chromaway AB for enterprise clients. 

How does Chromia work?
Chromia is a standalone Layer-1 blockchain and EVM compatible Layer-2 enhancement for Binance Smart Chain and Ethereum. It is designed to enhance existing dApps and allow for the creation of next-generation dApps by providing scalability, improved data handling, and customizable fee structures. The blockchain uses a unique architecture called relational blockchain, as well as a custom programming language called Rell.

Rell is designed to code and function very similarly to SQL, allowing developers to leverage the security and immutability of blockchain while storing and handling data with the efficiency of a relational database.  Each dApp running on Chromia operates on its own sidechain which is rooted in the main blockchain. This allows each application to scale more efficiently and gives each application developer the freedom to choose from a variety of fee structures. For example, one application may require users to pay transaction fees in CHR (similar to how Ethereum or Bitcoin work), while another application could stake enough CHR to reserve computational power and allow their users to make unlimited transactions without paying any fees at all. 

What applications have been built on Chromia?
Chromia already has a wide variety of applications building upon their blockchain, using their chain as a decentralized storage layer, and using their Layer-2 enhancements. These applications range from DeFi options trading platform Hedget, to open world farming game My Neighbor Alice, to government land registry initiative LAC PropertyChain.  One of the latest features in development is a new NFT standard called Chromia Originals, which will operate both as a native standard on Chromia’s chain as well as an enhancement layer for existing ERC-721 and BEP-721 tokens. Work on these Layer-2 enhancements are being developed in cooperation with My Neighbor Alice.

Who is behind Chromia?
Chromia’s core team consists of industry veterans Or Perelman, Henrik Hjelte and Alex Mizrahi. All three have deep roots in the crypto space, going back to the early days of Bitcoin and Ethereum. For example, Alex published several early academic papers on Proof of Stake consensus and was also one of the key figures behind Colored Coins, one of the first projects to develop the idea of ‘tokens’ that would later be brought to prominence by Ethereum.

In summary, Chromia is a Layer-1 and Layer-2 blockchain solution under active development, with the goal of delivering enhanced features and data handling and storage capabilities to decentralized applications.","","","artificial intelligence (ai)","ethereum","65.2","37.62103018458441","0.0","91.2","2938","0","34.6214","0"

Using the Saakuru Protocol alongside the Saakuru Developer Suite enables any product to add Web3 capability in just one day. The powerful and developer-friendly product suite allows a cost-efficient and seamless transition from Web2 to Web3.

The Saakuru Protocol is already live &amp; records more than 1.4 million transactions/week*, which already puts it into the top 20 public blockchains by transactions per week only nine months after network launch. This quick transaction growth is mainly influenced by its gasless nature and very fast block time. On top of that, Saakuru Labs has launched its own Developer Suite: a comprehensive set of highly interoperable modules like Mobile Wallet SDK, NFT management platform, Blockchain data API, and Gamification API, which allows products to embed essential Web3 modules directly to their products significantly reducing cost and speed for any go-to-market strategy.

The Saakuru token is a multi-purpose (utility &amp; governance) token of the Saakuru Protocol, notable for its innovative burning mechanism that methodically reduces supply through transaction fees, developer profits, and governance actions. Its demand is driven by a unique credit system that sustains a gas-less blockchain environment, enabling developers to stake SKR tokens to decrease operational costs. This model promotes active ecosystem participation, ensuring the token's utility and fostering sustainable growth.

SLP are tokens that can be used to breed new digital pets, known as Axies. It was formally known as Small Love Potion before the token upgrade to the Ronin blockchain.

The cost of breeding begins at 100 SLP but increases gradually — rising to 200 SLP for the second breed, 300 for the third, 500 for the fourth, 800 for the fifth, and 1,300 for the sixth. Axies can be bred a maximum of seven times, and the seventh breed costs 2,100 SLP. This limit exists in order to prevent hyperinflation in the marketplace.

SLP paves the way to the concept of Play-to-earn which popularizes the Axie Infinity games among players who are looking to earn some money or participate in DeFi. It is especially popular in countries like Philippines. ","","75.0","entertainment","ronin","13.200000000000001","37.96349564950333","0.0","20.0","854","0","16.78675","0"

uniETH represents the staked ETH in Bedrock plus all future staking rewards. uniETH is non-rebasing, i.e. does not grow in quantity over time but grows in value instead. In other words, 1 uniETH will be worth more than 1 ETH as time goes on, and its value will continue to increase as more time passes.

Launched by RockX, Bedrock is a non-custodial solution that satisfies the requirements of institutions seeking a basis for large-scale liquid staking. By bringing new levels of transparency and security to liquid staking, Bedrock allows institutions to unlock liquidity safely by adhering to regulations while leveraging a true crypto-native solution.

As part of a broader vision to launch Bitcoin Layer 2 Limited, BTCLE stands at the forefront of innovation, combining exclusivity, transparency, and decentralization with a long-term roadmap to reshape blockchain finance.
At its core, BTCLE is not simply an investment; it is a vision for the future of finance, where scarcity meets innovation. With the upcoming Bitcoin Layer 2 Limited initiative, we are building a scalable, efficient, and secure second layer anchored to the Bitcoin blockchain—the most secure network in existence.
With a clear goal to bridge Real World Assets (RWA) into crypto, we are providing a simplified and accessible pathway for the next billion users still tied to traditional finance. Through BTCLE governance, stakeholders will help shape a democratized financial system, empowering individuals and communities to participate in this new decentralized economy.

Tokenomics &amp; Liquidity

BTCLE follows strict security and decentralization policies to ensure long-term sustainability and trust:
Token Lock: Tokens vested gradually over 10 years, preventing sudden supply shocks.

Fair Distribution: No single entity holds disproportionate control, guaranteeing a balanced market structure.

This framework provides the foundation for a sustainable, community-driven cryptocurrency designed to grow securely and transparently for the long term.

Adserver platforms allow users to rent space inside Metaverse, blockchain games, NFT exhibitions and websites. 

Starting in 2017, the team delivered a protocol that is now highly scalable. Adshares is an umbrella project, maintaining a decentralized network. The idea behind the ADS protocol is to give the network to the community with DAO-style governance. In Adshares, anyone can make their own Adserver by implementing open-source blockchain tools in more and more areas. This breakthrough concept allows $ADS holders to take profit from monetization of the protocol. Crypto projects can advertise using a 100% decentralized marketplace.

Coins are deflationary due to the native burning and dividend mechanisms.

$ADS has its own ultra-fast dPoS blockchain, being also cross-chain to Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain and Polygon.

In the world of traditional finance, this process is typically facilitated by trusted and permissioned third-parties such as banks, who connect people with a surplus of money to those who need access to it in the short term. In the world of decentralised finance (DeFi), trusted and permissioned third-parties are no longer needed; banks have been replaced by trustless and permissionless lending protocols running on the blockchain (1).
Among the first-generation of DeFi lending protocols are Compound (2) and Aave (3). These protocols provide users with access to lending and borrowing capabilities for a handful of the most liquid ERC20 tokens. However, these protocols were not designed to handle the risks associated with lending and borrowing illiquid or volatile assets and have therefore relied on a permissioned listing system to protect their users from the risks associated with such assets.
Consequently, there remains significant unmet demand for lending and borrowing the long tail of crypto assets. On the lending side, users want to deposit tokens to earn yield and take leveraged long positions. On the borrowing side, users want to reduce their exposure to volatility and take leveraged short positions. Here, we present Euler: a permissionless lending protocol custom-built with an array of new features to help users lend and borrow more types of tokens than ever before.","","100.0","bnb chain ecosystem","ethereum","59.599999999999994","30.41403294181032","0.0","85.3","1490","0","33.13275","0"

It provides a tokenized service layer that exposes data, storage, compute and algorithms for consumption with a set of deterministic proofs on availability and integrity that serve as verifiable service agreements. There is staking on services to signal quality, reputation and ward against Sybil Attacks.

Ocean helps to unlock data, particularly for AI. It is designed for scale and uses blockchain technology that allows data to be shared and sold in a safe, secure and transparent manner.

The Ocean Protocol is an ecosystem composed of data assets and services, where assets are represented by data and algorithms, and services are represented by integration, processing and persistence mechanisms. Ocean Protocol facilitates discovery by storing and promoting metadata, linking assets and services, and provides a licensing framework that has toolsets for pricing.

A multitude of data marketplaces can hook into Ocean Protocol to provide “last mile” services to connect data providers and consumers. Ocean Protocol is designed so that data owners cannot be locked-in to any single marketplace. The data owner controls each dataset.","","0.0","artificial intelligence (ai)","ethereum","61.0","44.123551091342975","96.72202155464679","73.1","1217","0","63.93035754412638","0"

Instead of requiring startups or communities to build complex blockchain infrastructure, Sharp Economy provides plug-and-play tools to tokenize user engagement, learning, and growth.
Its focus areas include education, nonprofits, youth and college athletes, healthcare, creators, and builders, with partners already in the pipeline.
The ecosystem is powered by four key components:
- Sharp Platform – a no-code Web3 platform for tokenization and rewards.
- Sharp Token ($SHARP) – the fuel of the ecosystem, enabling rewards, growth, and governance.
- Sharp Protocol – decentralized infrastructure for tokenomics and distribution.
- Sharp Rewards App – a SocialFi super app that gamifies activities and rewards users daily.
Key features include Learn2Earn, Contribute2Earn, and Spend2Grow, which allow users to earn tokens for learning or contributing and spend them on personal growth.
Unlike most tokens, Sharp Economy is community-first, bridging millions of Web2 users into Web3 with real-world utility and sustainable growth.","","","gaming (gamefi)","polygon-pos","42.5","50.0176151035446","0.0","66.0","1146","0","28.29965","0"
