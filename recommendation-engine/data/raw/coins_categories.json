The protocol can then mint new tokens and sell them on the open market, generating revenue. This revenue is used to maintain the stablecoin's peg to its target value. If the stablecoin's value falls below its peg, the protocol can buy back tokens, reducing the supply and helping to restore the peg.",

Besides parachains, projects can participate in the Polkadot ecosystem for a shorter fixed period of time through parathreads. Blockchains built on top of Polkadot’s own relay chain are also interoperable with blockchains that have vastly different technology stacks such as Ethereum and Bitcoin through bridges.",
